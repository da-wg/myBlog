Hey there and welcome to my blog! Since discovering Bitcoin and crypto 9 months ago, I've spent all of my free time away from school work researching about everything in the space. I now feel like I have a good understanding of: 
- the history and major dates of crypto
- names and what they do of majority of the Top 100 coins  
- major areas of innovation (eg. DeFi, NFTs)
- Top DeFi protocols and basic understanding of their value proposition
- the hottest memes on crypto twitter (I personally think this is the most important)

However, I noticed that there are still various topics that I'm still confused about. These include: 
- Technical aspects of defi protocols (eg. how SUSHI fees are generated and distributed, how RUNE is able to do cross-chain swaps vs atomic swaps, ALPHA leveraged lending)
- NFTs (eg. how they are able to verify ownership, what are the next logical "next steps" for projects in this space)
- Insurance (eg. how insurance works in the crypto world)
- Solidity

Since this is a lot of stuff, I thought a blog will allow me to document my learning. I also wish to do a coop in this field so this blog will hopefully act as a sort of "resume" for the future. 

Most of the posts for the next couple of months will simply be me making notes straight from the videos and resources that I'm learning from. However, as time goes on, the goal is to start contributing insightful and critical posts about things that I notice. 

OK;LG!

### About me:  
I'm a 20 yr old post-secondary student from Canada. I've been very interested in learning about investing and trading for a couple of years, but never really got into it. I was originally just looking to start investing in the stock market, but after seeing what happened with the stock market after the March crash and the subsequent "V-shaped" reversal due to the Fed pumping trillions into the market, I felt like the current financial system didn't have the regular person's best interests at heart. This led me to look for a solution.    
Luckily, I found it relatively quickly in Bitcoin and "The Bitcoin Standard" book. Since then, I've become sort of obsessed with the rate of innovation in the space and truly believe it will be the future of finance (france, for the ct-inclined).  
Although I have not touched the stock market to date, I've realized that by doing so, I've created my own "crypto bubble" where all the arguments and discussions I see online are from people who are pro-Bitcoin and have a financial stake in the success of crypto. This is obviously detrimental to my ability to think critically and objectively about this space. Therefore, I will slowly start researching about traditional equities. The good news is, many of the concepts that I've picked up on through crypto is applicable to this area as well. 

### Structure: 
- categories will be the broad topics that the blog will be centered around (eg. crypto, trading, stocks, coding)
- series will be blog posts centered around a particular subsection within a category (eg. Bitcoin, altcoins, React)

There will also be an ongoing "book list" blog post which will be updated with what books I'm reading and any notes about the books I've finished. 

### How I created the website: 
The website was created using Hugo and the PaperMod theme and then hosted on GitHub Pages. The website/repos are listed here:
