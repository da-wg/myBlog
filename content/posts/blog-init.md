Hey there and welcome to my blog! During my last online school term, I made a list of things that I wanted to learn during my coop term, when I would have a little bit of free time. Since there was a lot of overlapping topics, I wanted to document everything I learn so I could look back in the future. This blog is the result of that wish and will hopefully allow me to do that. There is also a small part of me that wishes to enter the crypto/investment field so this blog will also hopefully act as a sort of "resume" for the future.

Most of the posts for the next couple of months will probably be me simply making notes straight from the videos and resources that I'm learning from. However, as time goes on, the goal is to start contributing insightful and critical posts about things that I notice. 

Although I intend to have this blog for a long time, I've only planned for the next calendar year. The goal is simple: 
1. make a butt load of money ($GME/$DOGE type money or bust)  
2. (very distant) learn a couple of things

Now onto a couple of administrative things: 

### Structure: 
- categories will be the broad topics that the blog will be centered around (eg. crypto, trading, stocks, coding)
- series will be blog posts centered around a particular subsection within a category (eg. Bitcoin, altcoins, React)

There will also be an ongoing "book list" blog post which will be updated with what books I'm reading and any notes about the books I've finished. 

### How I created the website: 
The website was created using Hugo and the PaperMod theme and then hosted on GitHub Pages. The website/repos are listed here: 
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [this blog](https://github.com/da-wg/myBlog)
- [hugo-PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)

Copyright blah blah blah, feel free to clone this blog and make any changes you wish. 

### About me:  
I'm a 20 yr old post-secondary student from Canada. I've been very interested in learning about investing and trading for a couple of years, but never really got into it. I was originally just looking to start investing in the stock market, but after seeing what happened with the stock market after the March crash and the subsequent "V-shaped" reversal due to the Fed pumping trillions into the market, I felt like the current financial system was no longer fair which led me to look for a solution.  
Luckily, I found it relatively quickly in Bitcoin and "The Bitcoin Standard" book. Since then, I've become sort of obsessed with the rate of innovation in the space and truly believe it will be the future of finance. I decided I would go "all-in" on crypto and not touch the stock market, out of principle.  
However, I recently realized that the result of this is that I've built my own bubble on Twitter (where I get the latest crypto and investing news) where everybody I see is pro-crypto, which is obviously detrimental to being able to think critical and objectively about crypto. On top of this, there are still plently of innovative, cutting-edge companies that I still want to invest in on the stock market. Therefore, this blog will still be based heavily around crypto, but there will be "traditional equities" as well.
