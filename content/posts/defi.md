## Lending and Borrowing: 
- one of the most important aspects of any financial system

*Money Market*: area of traditional finance that specializes in short term lending and borrowing

In crypto space, lending and borrowing occurs in two ways: 
- DeFi: AAVE, Compound etc
- CeFi: BlockFi, Celsius etc.

Value Proposition of DeFi Lending: Borrowing and lending in a decentralized, permissionless way while retaining full custody of your coins

Currently, all defi loans are over-collateralized (possible innovation opportunity?)

**over-collateralized**: borrowers has to supply collateral that is worth more than the loan they want to take. Why would somebody do this?  

- don't want to sell their tokens 
- delay or avoid capital gain taxes
- increase leverage


Obvious limitation of defi: a variable APY that's ever-changing and incredibly volatile requires people to constantly check in on their APY to ensure they don't get liquidated (AAVE's stable APY is average of last 30 days)
