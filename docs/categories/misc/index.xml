      <description>Hey there and welcome to my blog! During my last online school term, I made a list of things that I wanted to learn during my coop term, when I would have a little bit of free time. Since there was a lot of overlapping topics, I wanted to document everything I learn so I could look back in the future. This blog is the result of that wish and will hopefully allow me to do that.</description>
