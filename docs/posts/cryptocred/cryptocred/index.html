You can label them to give you context without having to jump back to the original time frame\nTime Frames  dictates the time period that 1 candle represents for beginners, focus on higher time frames (eg. Cred’s favourites are Daily and Hourly time frames)  Candle closes are very significant, especially at higher time frames - don’t get ahead of yourself before a candle close\nCandlestick Patterns  lots of candlestick patterns are reversal patterns. Beginner mistake is to try to trade every instance regardless of context. Don’t look for candlestick patterns when price is ranging, but do when there is a strong upwards/downwards trend Babypips Cheat Sheet Patterns mentioned in video:  Doji (Neutral)  Shooting Star (Bearish)  Hammar (Bullish)  Bullish Engulfing (Bullish)  Bearish Engulfing (Bearish)  Tweezer Tops (Bearish)  Tweezer Bottoms (Bullish)      2: Risk Management  Areas for further exploration: hedging, expectancy, laddering Lot of variables come down to personal preference  Manage risk so you can stay in the game\nStop Losses Stop Losses: an order to close a position at a certain price point/percentage to limit one’s losses\n stick to market stops, limit stops may not reach your actual target primary purpose is to protect a trader’s account balance when they are wrong on a trade (allows you to be profitable without having to win every time) based on technical analysis (not fixed percentages, R calculations etc.), place stop loss at invalidation level - point at which trader’s reason for taking the trade has been invalidated/disproved by the market aka where the price has no business of being with regard to your thesis. This will be unique depending on the setup  Risk Per Trade \u0026 Position Size Risk per trade: what percentage of total equity a trader stands to lose per trade\n most traders trade within 2-3% of equity per trade\nCalculation: total equity * risk % does NOT mean a trader buys units worth that amount eg. if a trader risks $300, that means if the trader gets stopped out, they lose $300  Position size: the number of units of an instrument a trader purchases. Two pieces of information:\n risk per trade distance to stop loss from entry in percentage (%) terms\ncalculation: (total equity * risk %)/ distance to stop loss from entry most platforms have calculators  R \u0026 Win Rate R/risk-reward ratio: number which reflects the amount of risk undertaken relative to the reward of a trade\ncalculation: reward/risk\n no gold standard R again, based on technical analysis. Also means targets should be realistics TradingView has a calculator  Win rate: % which reflects how many of a trader’s total trades are winning trades over a given period of time calculation: (winning trades/total trades) * 100\n Traders often split into two camps  higher R lower win rate setups lower R higher win rate setups   using average R, you can calculate the minimum win rate they must meet in order to be profitable calculation: 1/(1 + R) * 100`  Edgewonk Cheat Sheet\nEvolving R: the R of a trade is static upon entry, but as price moves away from entry, the R of the trade evolves and changes\n eg. price follows your thesis, misses your target by 1-2 points and then comes all the way back and stops you out for breakeven. recalculate R if it seems like the trade is changing  Handling Drawdown idea that the market will, at some point, hand your ass to you is just about the only certainity in trading\nMake sure a losing streak will not wipe you out: Potential drawdown mitigation checklist:\n Can your win rate and R take a losing streak on the chin? See table 2. Do you have trading rules/some sort of system for taking trades? Or are you gambling? Have you been following your trading rules? What links your losing trades? What links your winning trades? Do you simply need a break? Are you punting FOMO/revenge trades? Have you considered reducing your risk and increasing the quality of setups you take?  Margin Margin: borrowing capital from your borker to open a position larger than one would other be able to\n Cross margin: your entire available balance will be used to avoid liquidation (aka liquidation = your entire account gets nuked) isolated margin: fixed margin for a certain position (aka liquidation = balance used to open position gets nuked) Liquidations: the price at which your losses are such that the exchanges will forcibly close your position  Position size calculation does not change\n risk must still be the same   3: Order Flow market tend to make a lot more sense once you get into the mindsset of institutional order flow\nProblems Institutional Traders Face\n trading a lot of size, there are issues with slippage and front running (dedicated people looking for your asks/bids and not letting you get filled eg. ladder, order book, chart) how do institutional traders get around this issue? By engineering liquidity  Liquidity Longs = short liquidity (what do you need to go long? - shorts) Shorts = long liquidity (what do you need to go short? - longs)\nGoing back to institutional trader dilemma:\n if you want sellers, you make the market look like it’s going to shit itself if you want buyers, you make the market look like it’s going to go vertical  Liquidity Pools: areas where there are likely to be a lot of limit orders/stops\n pending limit orders = untapped liquidity, which is released/triggered by price trading through a certain area how to identify liquidity pools? simple test: where are retail traders taught to put their stops?  below swing lows above swing highs above range highs below range lows   how to filter probable liquidity pools from less probable liquidity pools?  Deep swing highs/lows → ones that stand out on the chart as swing points Swing points visible on the higher time frames tend to work better because more traders see them → more orders build up above/below them (Cred checks 15M, 1H, 1D) Extended consolidation ranges (orders on both sides of the range; traders trying to catch the breakout) HTF highs and lows (1D, 1W, even 1M) Equal highs/lows Always ask yourself: where are retail traders’ stops resting?    Stop Hunting Stop Hunting: where price trades through an area where retail stops were resting before\n example of how a market takes out a low/“break support” before proceeding higher. Two forms of stops:  stop losses of those who are long. When triggered, turn into market orders to sell limit order of those who are waiting to short. When triggered, turn into market order to sell The result is sell orders flood the market, creating engineered long liquidity. Institutions can find retail traders to buy from. Then they take the market higher In fact, sometimes institutional players will sometimes sell in order to force the market to go down, even if they want to long, because they know if they take out a specific low, there is a ton of liquidity that they can pick up   retail traders' stops create the liquidity pools for the institutional traders this is often why markets will take out a low before going vertical or take out a high before falling off a cliff. How do you distinguish? You can’t with 100% accuracy, which is why it works, but there are things you can do:  If possible, avoid putting your stops (both stop losses and limit orders) at obvious liquidity pool targets as discussed earlier Monitor the price action: if the move is a stop run, price will often give you a reaction when it takes out the high/low (tall wicks, slow down in momentum, failure to close above/below on a HTF, etc.) If you’re waiting for a clean break:  Clean HTF candle close through the level e.g. H1/H4 Safer: wait for the breakdown + bid/offer the retest   Divergence Keeping a trading journal    Sidenote: this probably happens more right before big moves. There’s probably leading indicators for big moves, like when you could see somebody was consistently buying over weeks (which turned out to be Saylor buying his BTC through Coinbase OTC). Obviously, he’s not a trader but there’s probably data that would indicate institutions are active in the markets.\n 4: Horizontal Support/Resistance  Art form, not a science when drawing levels Don’t try to force levels where they’re not clear - highest probability setups will come from clear setups that are worth waiting for  TradingView tips:\n horizontal line tool (Alt/Option+H) Magnet mode (snap) changing visibility so that lines are only visible on certain time frames  Resistance: area where we expect price to have a hard time going higher\nSupport: area where we expect price to have a hard time going lower\nTwo on the right on S/R flips:\nPrinciple 1 - S/R Flips S/R levels flip when broken by price\n A support level that is broken = resistance A resistance level that is broken = support  broken: a clean candle close through the level\nPrinciple 2 - Recurring Tests The more a level is test by price from the same direction, the weaker it becomes\n Think of it as more buyers/sellers getting absorbed with each test until eventually, during the nth time, there’s not enough buyers/sellers to hold that level and it breaks  However, it becomes strong if/when the S/R flips\nPrinciple 3 - First Test Best Test Corollary of Principle 2: the highest probability level trade is the first test of a broken from the other side\n first test of a broken resistance level (expected support) first test of a broken support level (expected resistance)  Strong Level Criteria  High number of touches (once the level has been broken)  More touches from the same direction = weaker level as buyers/sellers absorbed But once the level is broken and price is on the other side, it is fresh   Violent touches (once the level has been broken)  Violence = how strongly price reacted upon testing the level More violence i.e. bigger swings away = better   Based on recent price action  Extremely important so you don’t use levels that were good in the past but have now been washed Read the chart from right to left Interested in what recent market participants are doing   Long duration (once the level has been broken)  Levels that were respected as S/R for longer tend to be stronger E.g. level that was resistance for several weeks is likely to be a stronger support (when broken) than a level that was resistance for only a few hours    Drawing tip: candle closes/body doesn’t really matter, but refine your level by making sure it is hinged on the most recent lows before break downwards/most recent highs before break upwards\nTrading the Inverse: buying broken resistance \u0026 selling broken support\nTypes of Retests Two types of retests:\n Micro retests: lower time frames, occur virtually immediately after a level is broken. Lower probability Rounded retests: higher time frame, time and space between break and retest. Higher probability  Time Frames HTF are more reliable, but are way less frequent so you have to balance between quality and quantity\n Cred uses H1 and D1 time frames   5: Market Structure Not a canonical view (if such a thing exists)\nDefining Market Structure Sequence of (proximate) highs and lows in a given instrument\nSequence\n Bullish MS = higher highs and higher lows bearish MS = lower highs and lower lows  Swing Low: low with a HL on both sides Swing high: high with a LH on both sides\nConsider:\n recency significance of move following that high/low what’s the obvious/most outstanding high/low?  if it doesn’t look like a clear swing point from first glance, it likely won’t be the best structure    Note: Can be complimented with trends eg. HTF bull trend sees a LTF MSB = opportunity to dip buy etc.\nSelecting highs/low as MS anchors\n  use S/R as starting point\n  is the swing high/low confluent with another key level (eg. S/R, candle open)\n  focus on swing points that are visible and significant to the largest number of participants (low hanging fruit)\n  No unified MS per time frame\n  Don’t chase every MSB (sometimes it is a weak signal in an overridingly strong trend). Don’t become a breakout/breakdown chaser under the guise of MS\n  Identifying Breaks in Market Structure A shift in the sequence of highs/lows in the opposite direction\n bullish MSB: sequence of LH violated by the HH bearish MSB: sequence of HL violated by a LL  There are different definitions, this is just Cred’s (if it’s good enough for Cred, it’s good enough for me)\nCandle bodies vs wicks: doesn’t matter, just be consistent.\n Variant that Cred uses: Bodies for MS and closes above/below for MSB Other variants:  Wicks for MS and wicks above/below for MSB Wicks for MS and closes above/below for MSB   You’ll know a good breakout if you see one. If a breakout depends on looking at wicks vs bodies, it’s probably not that good/clearcut of a breakout  Times Frames:\n next section! generally, break has to occur in same time frame as the MS anchor  Directional bias shift in direction of the MSB\n Bullish MSB = Anticipating another HH (with or without a HL) = Bullish outlook, favouring long-side trades Bearish MSB: Anticipating another LL (with or without another LH) = Bearish outlook, favouring short-side trades (or staying out/taking profit/hedging etc. if long-only)  If trading counter-trend in MSB: You have to be more defensive cause you’re going against the trend\n Counter-trend trades: Shorter holding periods More conservative targets/FTA Greater minimum R:R requirements (usually with closer invalidation, not wider targets) More active trade management Different sizing (smaller/more conservative) don’t let winners “run” (generally do this more when you’re with a trend, not against)  Trading in direction of trend:\n Flip these around when trading in the direction of the MSB (or trend more broadly)  Using market structure to filter good S/R:\naka Ask what the level achieved (it broke market sturcture)\n Resistance (high) that preceded a bearish MSB (lower low) is strong resistance Support (low) that preceded a bullish (MSB) higher high is strong support  MSB as entry triggers:\nBasic premise:\n Bearish MSB at resistance for sell setups Bullish MSB at support for buy setups  Time frame:\n High time frame (Weekly/Daily) structure as an area to do business Low time frame (Hourly/M15 etc.) MSB as the trigger for the trade This time frame logic is often scaled down e.g. M5-M15 MSB at intraday levels etc.  Confirmation: much easier said than done!\n Often a trade-off: good confirmation and shite entry versus little/no confirmation and great entry  May create a poor habit of only entering a market once it moves (significantly) in your favour (DON’T DO THIS)   Cred’s Approach:  Daily market structure at Weekly levels (Or just using daily market structure on its own when the market is between levels and/or for LTF trading)    Trading Breaks in Market Structure Trades where you are reacting after the fact\nThree setups:\n Continuation from MS level/anchor  Bullish MSB requires HH. The long trade is taken on a pullback to the broken high. Bearish MSB requires LL. The short trade is taken on a pullback to the broken low. textbook S/R Identify MS → Identify MSB → Trade taken on a retest of Step 1\nInvalidation: Failing to flip the MS level (to support if bullish/to resistance if bearish)    2. Continuation from pullback level\n Bullish MSB requires HH. Continuation trade is taken below the breakout point but above the most recent low. Bearish MSB requires LL. Continuation trade is taken above the breakdown point but below the most recent high. reasoning: breaking and waiting until it forms a HL (for bullish) not as clean as the first, but hey that’s life  The MSB is an impulsive move. The market may continue the impulse (Setup 1) or retrace the impulse before continuing (Setup 2).   where to look for retracement? Fibonacci retracement (lesson 7 below)  R:R consideration: The deeper price reaches into the pullback area, the superior the R:R\n This is because deeper pullback = closer to invalidation however, like always, depends on context  Reversal   focus on trading opposite of a MSB once certain conditions are met  MSB failed to offer continuation. Failed continuation is suggestive of reversal   reasoning:  HH = Bullish / LL = Bearish Invalidation = LL / Invalidation = HH HH into LL = Bulls offside / LL into HH = Bears offside Bulls offside = Sell setup / Bears offside = Buy setup    Always seek to exert pressure on those weakest in the market\nDisclaimers: don’t actively look for trades or force something on the market (especially relevant when you’re first learning something)\n you can do everything correctly and still lose money Don’t take ‘cut and reverse’ as a given (good bearish setups that fail are bullish and vice versa)  Sometimes you just have the wrong read/identified a shitty time and place to do business   Harder parts of setups is sizing, execution, management, choosing targets etc. → all separate videos/articles!  Nuances Time Frame\n HTF will result in larger breaks and longer moves, LTF will result in smaller breaks and smaller moves lower time frame MSB does not cancel a HTF dominant trend  Market Structure in a Range\n In less volatile conditions, less obvious/shorter-term MSB can be pure noise/chop Best practice is to focus on MSB at the extremities of the range rather than chasing every HH/LL at the range midpoint  Slowdown/early signs of reversal\n One of the key benefits of MS is that it gives a lot of weight to recency. This can provide early hints of trend reversal or a slowdown more generally Be cognisant of shifts in behaviour when a dominant trend (or MS) is intact  Bullish example: Clear lower highs and lower lows starting to form equal/higher lows Bearish example: Clear higher highs and higher lows starting to form equal/lower highs   waiting for a clear signal is often too late   6: Time Frames Managing Expectation Trying to answer the question: what can be reasonably expected from price at a level on a given time frame?\nBasic principles\n High time frame (“HTF”) trends are longer and harder to reverse Bigger moves more likely to originate from HTF levels (or intraday levels formed at/within HTF levels) Price can take more time to resolve at HTF levels  Time Frame Selection  even for LTF traders, mapping HTF levels is useful  just because you don’t draw a level doesn’t mean it stops existing (avoid getting smacked by an “invisible force” that ends up being just a HTF structure)   you don’t need to “choose” just one time frame, depends on context  Ascertaining trend/deriving directional bias Delineating levels Engaging the market/entry triggers Managing the trade The above do not have to be uniform when with regard to time frames    Trend Precedence/Market Structure always more than one trend at any given time on an instrument\nQuestion to ask: what is the dominant trend and what intraday conditions would allow for positioning in tandem with the trend?\nGeneral Principles:\n  Dominant trend is most reliably derived from HTF charts (Monthly/Weekly/Daily)\n  If a dominant trend is present on HTF then persuasive signs of reversal must also form on HTF\n I.e. not buying every green H1 candle in a weekly downtrend    HTF trends last longer than LTF trends (self-evident but easily forgotten)\n  LTF moves against dominant trend are counter-trend trading (fading) opportunities until proven otherwise (when you have a minor move you can either: 1. be an idiot and say “this time it’s different” and try to catch the bottom/top of reversal or 2. assume it’s just a retracement before continuing the dominant trend)\n  fading: stepping in when you see a minor retracement in an anticipation of trend continuation\n  sometimes you will be wrong and it will be a reversal, but it’s still better to assume (better to catch most of the move and lose 1 then lose most and win 1)\n  HTF bearish = broken support likely to turn resistance + selling rallies\n  HTF bullish = broken resistance likely to turn support + buying dips\n  same price behaviour, but depending on context (bullish vs bearish dominant trends) can mean completely different things\nRefining \u0026 Contextualising Levels common stumbling point: drawing every single level on a chart from a multitude of time frames\nRefining:\n Delineate HTF level (silly as it may sound, use a thick line and different colour)  Simplest way: lowest candle close preceding rally (support)/highest candle close preceding a decline (resistance)   Find LTF levels in reasonable proximity to the zone Can elect to keep the refined LTF level, keep only HTF level, make a zone/box, and so on → guide/filter   expectation to keep in mind is that a HTF structure, if it does its job, will steamroll LTF structure so don’t try to fade every move coming off HTF structue with nearby LTF structure. Again, context  eg. if there’s a HTF support and LTF resistance $20 away, don’t sell at resistance if it bounces off HTF support because it’s probably going to steamroll LTF resistance use LTF levels as an area to compound trade or check in on your trade    Entry Triggers Very personal/subjective: market at candle closes, blind limits, market following reaction at level, one hit versus scaling in, etc.\nCred’s opinions:\n HTF levels require more patience or, alternatively, can be given more time No need to be entirely uniform in time frame selection, especially with regard to entries  Especially with ‘price action entries’ i.e. waiting for LTF evidence of strength/weakness at HTF levels   LTF closes at HTF levels are not particularly reliable; you could end up selling the bottom/buying the top eg.  if a weekly has a wick below the level, then there was probably a hourly/daily close below the level. That doesn’t mean the level is invalidated markets aren’t perfect, wait until close of timeframe     Trade Management Most subjective part, real answers will come from trading journal - managing a trade (and how) versus leaving original parameters as they were\nCred’s opinions:\n beginners have a tendency to be impatient at levels and look for excuses to manage a trade, give your ideas a time to play out being hand-offs in HTF trades is a skill in itself manage on same time frame that it is derived from (or slightly different eg H1 setup, manage on 30M/1H)  Important: Context  structure\nQuick checklist:\n What is the dominant trend (if any)? Have I mapped my HTF (and LTF) levels? Am I aware what type of level/structure price is coming from? Given the above, is my fade or continuation entry reasonable? If yes, what are my entry criteria/parameters for engagement? How do I now manage the position?   7: Fibonacci Levels Subjective; this video covers the basics\n50%/0.5 isn’t a Fibonacci number but is an important retracement level nonetheless\nSetting Up TradingView: third from the top and then halfway down the dropdown\nSettings: Fibonacci Anchor Selection - Which Highs/Low to Pick Swing High: a high + lower high on both sides Swing Low: a low + higher low on low on both sides\nWicks or candle bodies? Cred uses the wick\nWhich specific swing high/low is a good place for an anchor?\n the good ones tend to be the obvious ones, deep/obvious/stand out swings → ones which your eye is drawn to Remember institutional order flow lesson: which swing high/low will entice traders? valid across all time frames  Using Fib Levels to Identify Support/Entries Premise: using Fib levels to identify where price may retrace to after moving up\nHow:\n Identify the base of the rally - a swing low Identify the peak of the rally - a swing high/self-evident ‘top’ Select your Fibonacci retracement tool Click 1: swing low Click 2: swing high Fibonacci levels will appear  Using Fib Levels to Identify Resistance/Targets  Identify the peak of the rally - a swing high Identify the bottom of the move down - a swing low Select your Fibonacci retracement tool Click 1: swing high Click 2: swing low Fibonacci levels will appear  Using Fib Levels to Identify Resistance/Targets at ATH Premise: using Fibonacci levels to identify plausible targets/resistance when price is at ATH\n Identify a significant swing high AND/OR ATH Identify a significant swing low AND/OR ATL Click 1: the high Click 2: the low Fibonacci levels, including extension (1.XXX/2.XXX et cetera) levels, will appear  Advanced Concept One can also use the same Fibonacci setup to set targets if price finds support/resistance at a Fibonacci level by using negative fibs. However, take some profits at 0 in case it fails to break out\nHow Cred uses Fibonacci Levels  Mapping 1D Fibonacci levels based on big moves/deep swings Confluence only → I never trade a Fibonacci level on its own  because how do you know which fib/negative fib level to use? Depends on your other S/R levels   I pay the most attention to .382/.5/.618 Fibonacci levels   8: Mastering RSI In bull/bear markets, it’s not overly useful because it can stay overbought or oversold for a really long time\nRSI: Relative Strength Index\n momentum oscillator which emasures the speed and change of price movements more valuable and accurate with more price data you can change the period. Shorter the period, more sensitive RSI becomes and wider its amplitude oscillator: a technical analysis tool that constructs high and low bands between two extreme values, and then builds a trend indicator that fulctuates within these bounds  Formula:\nRSI = 100 - (100/1+RS) where\nRS = Average Gain/Average Loss\nAverage Gain = [(previous Average Gain) x 13 + current Gain] / 14\nAverage Loss = [(previous Average Loss) x 13 + current Loss] / 14\nComplete basics: an instrument is overbought when RSI is above 70 and oversold when RSI is below 30 (in bull markets, it becomes 80 and in bear markets, it becomes 20)\nTrading RSI  open long positions or close shorts when RSI crosses from below 30 to above 30 (bulls are stepping in) open shorts or close longs when RSI crosses from above 70 to below 70 trade with the trend (if in a downtrend, sell the overbought with more confidence)  Midpoint Value Crosses Three main uses (use on HTF like 4H and 1D):\n Indicate whether there’s a bullish or bearish bias in the trend (amount of time RSI spends above/below 50) Indicate whether a trend reversal will happen (treat 50 as S/R) Indicate periods of consolidation (cutting through both sides repeatedly)  Trendlines  Simply, identify the trend of the instrument ‘Confirm’ a breakout/breakdown of a pattern Indicate trend reversals when RSI breaks resistance/support lines  Divergences A divergence is when the oscillator shows something different than what price is showing i.e. the oscillator does not follow price\nBullish divergence: price makes lower low, indicator makes higher low\nBearish divergence: price makes higher high, indicator makes lower high\nHidden bullish divergence: price makes higher low, indicator makes lower low\nHidden bearish divergence: price makes lower high, indicator makes higher high\nHow to use:\n In a downtrend, to identify where bearish momentum is fading and pre-empting a trend reversal In an uptrend, to identify where bullish momentum is fading and pre-empting a trend reversal aka avoid buying the top or selling the bottom  Failure Swings A failure swing is when at the extreme values, RSI fails to make a higher high/lower low and reverses in the opposite direction\nTwo types:\nTop failure swing (peak in RSI over 70): fails to exceed previous peak in an uptrend and then breaks a previous bottom\nBottom failure swing (bottom in RSI under 30): fails to set a new low and then breaks a previous top\nUses: same as divergence (avoid buying top or selling bottom and predicate trend reversal)\n 9: Ichimoku Cloud Setup: In tradingview, go into indicators and click ichimoku cloud\n adjusted settings for crypto (b/c it’s 24/7 market) and then double to get more conservative signals: 20/60/120/30  Finding S/R:\n kumo cloud kijun sen tenkan sen incorporated with other trend lines/levels/patterns etc.  Ichimoku Cloud Trading Strategies Time Frames: 30M, 1H, 4H, 1D. Higher = stronger and less noise\n  Tenkan-Kijun Cross (TK Cross): when the Tenkan Sen (conversion line) crosses above or below the Kijun Sen (Base line)\n When Tenkan (blue) crosses from below to above cherry line, it’s bullish When it crosses from above to below, it’s bearish  Quality of signal depends on where it is in reference to the Kumo Cloud:\n Bullish TK cross above the Kumo = strong bullish signal, whereas the same TK cross below the Kumo only signals to close shorts (combining TK Cross with Kumo Breakout) Bearish TK cross inside the Kumo is a neutral bearish signal, whereas the same TK cross below the Kumo would be a strong sell signal     Kumo Breakout  when price breaks up through the top of the Kumo Cloud = bullish when price breaks down below the last line of the Kumo Cloud = bearish when price is within the cloud, this is a no-trade zone for Cred with the exception of an edge-to-edge (next)     Kumo Edge-To-Edge: if price enters the cloud and stays there, there’s a reasonable chance that price reaches the opposite end of the cloud especially if the opposite line is flat   Kijun Bounce: when price retraces to the Kijun Sen and successfully uses it as support level   Kijun Cross  when price crosses from below to above the cherry line, it’s a bullish signal when price crosses from above to below the cherry line, it’s bearish      Kumo Twists/Senkou Span Cross\n If you want to buy, look for future Kumo to be green If you want to sell, look for the future Kumo to be red    Ichimoku as an Oscillator/TK disequilibrium: the greater the disparity between the Kijun Sen and the Tenkan Sen, the more overbought/oversold the price is (depending on the trend)\n   10: Entry Triggers  Not exhaustive entry triggers Not a one-size-fits-all approach  Limit Orders: an order to buy/sell an instrument at a specific price (or better)\n Limit Sell: sell at/above market Limit Buy: buy at/below market  Pros: usually cheaper exchange fees\nCons: fills not guaranteed. As a result, stop loss orders must always be market orders\nMarket Orders: an order to buy/sell an instrument at the best possible price that is available immediately\nPro: guarantees full size execution/fill, instant\nCons: more expensive exchange fees, slippage\nLimit Orders Entries  BPC (Break Pullback Continuation): limit buy at a structure immediately after break upwards/limit sell at a structure immediately after a break downwards. Essentially break-and-retest strategy  Cons: more attention to lower time frames, low probability of working      Rounded Retest: limit buy at a structure after break upwards with time and space/limit sell at a structure after a break downwards with time and space\n Pros: higher probability, higher time frame Cons: tunnel vision/easier to lose sight of context, easier to “forget” about the trade     Conditionals: limit buys below old lows in bullish conditions/limit sells above old highs in bearish conditions\n hardest one, Cred doesnt use it at all. Pros: minimal drawdown Cons: stop placements not always clear, not always intuitive to choose which highs/lows will be run if stops have built up e.g. diagonal trend    Market Orders Entries  Market Structure: market buy at support if low time frames are breaking upwards/market sell at resistance if low time frames are breaking downwards. Discretionary for when you step in, just look for evidence  hard, not recommended for beginners Pros: more likely to avoid trades where the structure gets completely smashed (eg. rounded retest) Cons: likely to miss trades if you’re not immediate, may take a while to play out, takes lots of discipline to trade intraday market structure at HTF levels.     Candle Close: market buy after bullish candle close at support/market sell after bearish candle close at resistance  Pros: more likely to avoid trades where the structure gets completely smashed (eg. rounded retest), easy to backtest and journal Cons: poor R/R if very strong reaction at the structure     Momentum: market buy after key resistance smashed/market sell after key support smashed on a closing basis  Premium: markets don’t always retrace/retest levels Pros: catch impulsive moves that don’t retrace Cons: can form bad habit of chasing the market, study the market you trade to see if there’s a need for momentum trading Checklist:  good reason to think price will move higher/lower clear invalidation clear target actionable R:R → trade can be taken in ‘no man’s land’ at market       Acceptance: market buy on consecutive candle closes above resistance/market sell on consecutive candle closes below support  Pros: doesn’t require precision entries or require much time babysitting the charts Cons: needs patience, takes a while to play out     11: Support/Resistance Trade Setup (Clean Double Close/CDC)  Specific S/R setup that Cred trades  Immediate vs Rounded\n Immediate: price closes back below resistance/above support in the next candle* Rounded: price runs away having broken the level but fails on the eventual retest of the level  Bullish Clean Double Close:\n Support level forms Price closes below the level When price next trades to the level, it closes above it impulsively Crucially: there must be no touches/retests in between  Bearish Clean Double Close\n Resistance level forms Price closes above the level When price next trades to the level, it closes below it impulsively Crucially: there must be no touches/retests in between  Structure:\n The level must be cleanly broken both ways but especially on the second break i.e. the trap There must be no retest/wick/interaction of any kind between break 1 and break 2 no variant better than the others  Time Frames:\n HTF are superior, especially daily  Entry Triggers  Option 1: market order on candle close through the level  Clear trigger but some discretion as to whether the break is impulsive enough Aggressive Can be inactionable in terms of R:R if price closed too far from the level   Option 2: limit order at the broken level once candle has closed through it  Clearest trigger Conservative Can assess in advance whether the setup is actionable or not Risk of not being filled/price not pulling back (This is normal in trading)   Option 3: market order at the broken level once price retests it following the break  Most discretionary trigger If your trading style deals well with reactions at a level, you’ll probably do this anyway Harder to track    Stop Placement Whichever you employ: make sure your stop doesn’t land at an S/R level → always check!\nContext is very important here and will usually dictate which is more appropriate\n Option 1: thrust candle stop  If bullish: stop below the candle that broke the level the second time If bearish: stop above the candle that broke the level the second time Reasonably aggressive, can sometimes be too tight if the candle that broke the level isn’t particularly big. If so, move a couple of candles back. Works best with a big (and ideally engulfing) candle     Option 2: furthermost deviation  If bullish: lowest low made before the level was broken again If bearish: highest high made before the level was broken again Conservative, but won’t always give actionable R:R e.g. with rounded retests that made a lot of space    Probability Enhancers  Good level selection: clear, high time frame, violent and significant levels perform better than random highs/lows Second break/break back through the level should be strong and fast: stronger/faster break = less time for those offside to mitigate = more traders trapped. Ideally some sort of engulfing candle First/false break spikes into liquidity: provides a factor of confluence that the first move was a trap Trend considerations  In an uptrend, bullish CDC setups are more likely to form and are higher probability  With the aim of bringing in shorts for long liquidity → upside continuation   In a downtrend, bearish CDC setups are more likely to form and are higher probability  With the aim of bringing in longs for short liquidity → downside continuation       Summary  Next Steps:\n learn more candlestick patterns research into hedging, expectancy, laddering risk management funding liquidations data and stats for the market bullish/bearish divergence indicators for when big players are trading/active in the markets look up more oscillators (MACD, B)  ",

<strong>Stop Losses:</strong> an order to close a position at a certain price point/percentage to limit one&rsquo;s losses</p>
<ul>
<li>stick to market stops, limit stops may not reach your actual target</li>
<li>primary purpose is to protect a trader&rsquo;s account balance when they are wrong on a trade (allows you to be profitable without having to win every time)</li>
<li>based on technical analysis (not fixed percentages, R calculations etc.), place stop loss at <strong>invalidation level</strong> - point at which trader&rsquo;s reason for taking the trade has been invalidated/disproved by the market aka where the price has no business of being with regard to your thesis.

<h3 id="risk-per-trade--position-size">Risk Per Trade &amp; Position Size<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#risk-per-trade--position-size">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Risk per trade:</strong> what percentage of total equity a trader stands to lose per trade</p>
<ul>
<li>most traders trade within 2-3% of equity per trade<br>
<code>Calculation: total equity * risk %</code></li>
<li>does NOT mean a trader buys units worth that amount</li>
<li>eg. if a trader risks $300, that means if the trader gets stopped out, they lose $300</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Position size:</strong> the number of units of an instrument a trader purchases. Two pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>risk per trade</li>
<li>distance to stop loss from entry in percentage (%) terms<br>

<p><strong>Win rate:</strong> % which reflects how many of a trader&rsquo;s total trades are winning trades over a given period of time
<code>calculation: (winning trades/total trades) * 100</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Traders often split into two camps
<ul>
<li>higher R lower win rate setups</li>
<li>lower R higher win rate setups</li>
</ul>

<p>Potential drawdown mitigation checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can your win rate and R take a losing streak on the chin? See table 2.</li>
<li>Do you have trading rules/some sort of system for taking trades? Or are you gambling?</li>
<li>Have you been following your trading rules?</li>
<li>What links your losing trades? What links your winning trades?</li>

<h2 id="3-order-flow">3: Order Flow<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-order-flow">#</a></h2>
<p>market tend to make a lot more sense once you get into the mindsset of institutional order flow</p>
<p>Problems Institutional Traders Face</p>
<ul>
<li>trading a lot of size, there are issues with slippage and front running (dedicated people looking for your asks/bids and not letting you get filled eg. ladder, order book, chart)</li>
<li>how do institutional traders get around this issue? By <strong>engineering liquidity</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="liquidity">Liquidity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#liquidity">#</a></h3>
<p>Longs = short liquidity (what do you need to go long? -&gt; shorts)
Shorts = long liquidity (what do you need to go short? -&gt; longs)<br>
Going back to institutional trader dilemma:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you want sellers, you make the market look like it&rsquo;s going to shit itself</li>
<li>if you want buyers, you make the market look like it&rsquo;s going to go vertical</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Liquidity Pools:</strong> areas where there are likely to be a lot of limit orders/stops</p>
<ul>
<li>pending limit orders = untapped liquidity, which is released/triggered by price trading through a certain area</li>
<li>how to identify liquidity pools? simple test: where are retail traders taught to put their stops?
<ul>
<li>below swing lows</li>
<li>above swing highs</li>
<li>above range highs</li>
<li>below range lows</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>how to filter probable liquidity pools from less probable liquidity pools?
<ul>
<li>Deep swing highs/lows → ones that stand out on the chart as swing points</li>
<li>Swing points visible on the higher time frames tend to work better because more traders see them → more orders build up above/below them (Cred checks 15M, 1H, 1D)</li>
<li>Extended consolidation ranges (orders on both sides of the range; traders trying to catch the breakout)</li>
<li>HTF highs and lows (1D, 1W, even 1M)</li>
<li>Equal highs/lows</li>
<li>Always ask yourself: where are retail traders’ stops resting?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stop-hunting">Stop Hunting<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#stop-hunting">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Stop Hunting:</strong> where price trades through an area where retail stops were resting before</p>
<ul>
<li>example of how a market takes out a low/&ldquo;break support&rdquo; before proceeding higher. Two forms of stops:
<ul>
<li>stop losses of those who are long. When triggered, turn into market orders to sell</li>
<li>limit order of those who are waiting to short. When triggered, turn into market order to sell</li>
<li>The result is sell orders flood the market, creating engineered long liquidity. Institutions can find retail traders to buy from. Then they take the market higher</li>
<li>In fact, sometimes institutional players will sometimes sell in order to force the market to go down, even if they want to long, because they know if they take out a specific low, there is a ton of liquidity that they can pick up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>retail traders' stops create the liquidity pools for the institutional traders</li>
<li>this is often why markets will take out a low before going vertical or take out a high before falling off a cliff. How do you distinguish? You can&rsquo;t with 100% accuracy, which is why it works, but there are things you can do:
<ul>
<li>If possible, avoid putting your stops (both stop losses and limit orders) at obvious liquidity pool targets as discussed earlier</li>
<li>Monitor the price action: if the move is a stop run, price will often give you a reaction when it takes out the high/low  (tall wicks, slow down in momentum, failure to close above/below on a HTF, etc.)</li>
<li>If you’re waiting for a clean break:
<ul>
<li>Clean HTF candle close through the level e.g. H1/H4</li>
<li>Safer: wait for the breakdown + bid/offer the retest</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Divergence</li>
<li>Keeping a trading journal</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> this probably happens more right before big moves. There&rsquo;s probably leading indicators for big moves, like when you could see somebody was consistently buying over weeks (which turned out to be Saylor buying his BTC through Coinbase OTC). Obviously, he&rsquo;s not a trader but there&rsquo;s probably data that would indicate institutions are active in the markets.</p>

<p>The more a level is test by price from the same direction, the weaker it becomes</p>
<ul>
<li>Think of it as more buyers/sellers getting absorbed with each test until eventually, during the nth time, there&rsquo;s not enough buyers/sellers to hold that level and it breaks</li>

<h3 id="strong-level-criteria">Strong Level Criteria<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#strong-level-criteria">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>High number of touches (once the level has been broken)
<ul>
<li>More touches from the same direction = weaker level as buyers/sellers absorbed</li>
<li>But once the level is broken and price is on the other side, it is fresh</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Violent touches (once the level has been broken)
<ul>
<li>Violence = how strongly price reacted upon testing the level</li>
<li>More violence i.e. bigger swings away = better</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Based on recent price action
<ul>
<li>Extremely important so you don’t use levels that were good in the past but have now been washed</li>
<li>Read the chart from right to left</li>
<li>Interested in what recent market participants are doing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Long duration (once the level has been broken)
<ul>
<li>Levels that were respected as S/R for longer tend to be stronger</li>
<li>E.g. level that was resistance for several weeks is likely to be a stronger support (when broken) than a level that was resistance for only a few hours</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Drawing tip: candle closes/body doesn&rsquo;t really matter, but refine your level by making sure it is hinged on the most recent lows before break downwards/most recent highs before break upwards</p>

<ul>
<li>recency</li>
<li>significance of move following that high/low</li>

<li>Wicks for MS and closes above/below for MSB</li>

<p>Times Frames:</p>

<li>generally, break has to occur in same time frame as the MS anchor</li>
</ul>
<p>Directional bias shift in direction of the MSB</p>
<ul>
<li>Bullish MSB = Anticipating another HH (with or without a HL) = Bullish outlook, favouring long-side trades</li>
<li>Bearish MSB: Anticipating another LL (with or without another LH) = Bearish outlook, favouring short-side trades (or staying out/taking profit/hedging etc. if long-only)</li>
</ul>
<p>If trading counter-trend in MSB: You have to be more defensive cause you&rsquo;re going against the trend</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter-trend trades:</li>
<li>Shorter holding periods</li>
<li>More conservative targets/FTA</li>
<li>Greater minimum R:R requirements (usually with closer invalidation, not wider targets)</li>
<li>More active trade management</li>
<li>Different sizing (smaller/more conservative)</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t let winners &ldquo;run&rdquo; (generally do this more when you&rsquo;re with a trend, not against)</li>
</ul>
<p>Trading in direction of trend:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flip these around when trading in the direction of the MSB (or trend more broadly)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using market structure to filter good S/R:<br>
aka Ask what the level achieved (it broke market sturcture)</p>
<ul>
<li>Resistance (high) that preceded a bearish MSB (lower low) is strong resistance</li>
<li>Support (low) that preceded a bullish (MSB) higher high is strong support</li>

<p><img src="../../../posts/cryptocred/img/5/S-R.png" alt="S/R"></p>
<p>MSB as entry triggers:<br>
Basic premise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bearish MSB at resistance for sell setups</li>
<li>Bullish MSB at support for buy setups</li>
</ul>
<p>Time frame:</p>
<ul>
<li>High time frame (Weekly/Daily) structure as an area to do business</li>
<li>Low time frame (Hourly/M15 etc.) MSB as the trigger for the trade</li>
<li>This time frame logic is often scaled down e.g. M5-M15 MSB at intraday levels etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Confirmation: much easier said than done!</p>
<ul>
<li>Often a trade-off: good confirmation and shite entry versus little/no confirmation and great entry
<ul>
<li>May create a poor habit of only entering a market once it moves (significantly) in your favour (DON&rsquo;T DO THIS)</li>
</ul>

<p>Trades where you are reacting after the fact</p>
<p>Three setups:</p>
<ol>
<li>Continuation from MS level/anchor
<ul>
<li>Bullish MSB requires HH. The long trade is taken on a pullback to the broken high.</li>
<li>Bearish MSB requires LL. The short trade is taken on a pullback to the broken low.</li>
<li>textbook S/R
Identify MS → Identify MSB → Trade taken on a retest of Step 1<br>
Invalidation: Failing to flip the MS level (to support if bullish/to resistance if bearish)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../../../posts/cryptocred/img/5/MSBretest.png" alt="MSB retest">
2. Continuation from pullback level</p>
<ul>
<li>Bullish MSB requires HH. Continuation trade is taken below the breakout point but above the most recent low.</li>
<li>Bearish MSB requires LL. Continuation trade is taken above the breakdown point but below the most recent high.</li>
<li>reasoning: breaking and waiting until it forms a HL (for bullish)</li>
<li>not as clean as the first, but hey that&rsquo;s life
<ul>
<li>The MSB is an impulsive move. The market may continue the impulse (Setup 1) or retrace the impulse before continuing (Setup 2).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>where to look for retracement? Fibonacci retracement (lesson 7 below)</li>
</ul>
<p>R:R consideration: The deeper price reaches into the pullback area, the superior the R:R</p>
<ul>
<li>This is because deeper pullback = closer to invalidation</li>
<li>however, like always, depends on context</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../../posts/cryptocred/img/5/MSBretestandpullback.png" alt="MSBretestandpullback"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Reversal</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>focus on trading opposite of a MSB once certain conditions are met
<ul>
<li>MSB failed to offer continuation. Failed continuation is suggestive of reversal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>reasoning:
<ol>
<li>HH = Bullish / LL = Bearish</li>
<li>Invalidation = LL / Invalidation = HH</li>
<li>HH into LL = Bulls offside / LL into HH = Bears offside</li>
<li>Bulls offside = Sell setup / Bears offside = Buy setup</li>

<ul>
<li>you can do everything correctly and still lose money</li>
<li>Don’t take ‘cut and reverse’ as a given (good bearish setups that fail are bullish and vice versa)

<ul>
<li>HTF will result in larger breaks and longer moves, LTF will result in smaller breaks and smaller moves</li>
<li>lower time frame MSB does not cancel a HTF dominant trend</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Market Structure in a Range</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In less volatile conditions, less obvious/shorter-term MSB can be pure noise/chop</li>
<li>Best practice is to focus on MSB at the extremities of the range rather than chasing every HH/LL at the range midpoint</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Slowdown/early signs of reversal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One of the key benefits of MS is that it gives a lot of weight to recency. This can provide early hints of trend reversal or a slowdown more generally</li>
<li>Be cognisant of shifts in behaviour when a dominant trend (or MS) is intact
<ul>
<li>Bullish example: Clear lower highs and lower lows starting to form equal/higher lows</li>

<h3 id="managing-expectation">Managing Expectation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#managing-expectation">#</a></h3>
<p>Trying to answer the question: what can be reasonably expected from price at a level on a given time frame?</p>
<p>Basic principles</p>
<ul>
<li>High time frame (“HTF”) trends are longer and harder to reverse</li>
<li>Bigger moves more likely to originate from HTF levels (or intraday levels formed at/within HTF levels)</li>
<li>Price can take more time to resolve at HTF levels</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-frame-selection">Time Frame Selection<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#time-frame-selection">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>even for LTF traders, mapping HTF levels is useful
<ul>
<li>just because you don&rsquo;t draw a level doesn&rsquo;t mean it stops existing (avoid getting smacked by an &ldquo;invisible force&rdquo; that ends up being just a HTF structure)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>you don&rsquo;t need to &ldquo;choose&rdquo; just one time frame, depends on context
<ul>
<li>Ascertaining trend/deriving directional bias</li>
<li>Delineating levels</li>
<li>Engaging the market/entry triggers</li>
<li>Managing the trade</li>
<li>The above do not have to be uniform when with regard to time frames</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="trend-precedencemarket-structure">Trend Precedence/Market Structure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#trend-precedencemarket-structure">#</a></h3>
<p>always more than one trend at any given time on an instrument</p>
<p>Question to ask: what is the dominant trend and what intraday conditions would allow for positioning in tandem with the trend?</p>
<p>General Principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dominant trend is most reliably derived from HTF charts (Monthly/Weekly/Daily)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a dominant trend is present on HTF then persuasive signs of reversal must also form on HTF</p>
<ul>
<li>I.e. not buying every green H1 candle in a weekly downtrend</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTF trends last longer than LTF trends (self-evident but easily forgotten)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LTF moves against dominant trend are counter-trend trading (fading) opportunities until proven otherwise (when you have a minor move you can either: 1. be an idiot and say &ldquo;this time it&rsquo;s different&rdquo; and try to catch the bottom/top of reversal or 2. assume it&rsquo;s just a retracement before continuing the dominant trend)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fading:</strong> stepping in when you see a minor retracement in an anticipation of trend continuation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sometimes you will be wrong and it will be a reversal, but it&rsquo;s still better to assume (better to catch most of the move and lose 1 then lose most and win 1)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTF bearish = broken support likely to turn resistance + selling rallies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTF bullish = broken resistance likely to turn support + buying dips</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>same price behaviour, but depending on context (bullish vs bearish dominant trends) can mean completely different things</p>
<h3 id="refining--contextualising-levels">Refining &amp; Contextualising Levels<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#refining--contextualising-levels">#</a></h3>
<p>common stumbling point: drawing every single level on a chart from a multitude of time frames</p>
<p>Refining:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delineate HTF level (silly as it may sound, use a thick line and different colour)
<ul>
<li>Simplest way: lowest candle close preceding rally (support)/highest candle close preceding a decline (resistance)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Find LTF levels in reasonable proximity to the zone</li>
<li>Can elect to keep the refined LTF level, keep only HTF level, make a zone/box, and so on → guide/filter</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>expectation to keep in mind is that a HTF structure, if it does its job, will steamroll LTF structure so don&rsquo;t try to fade every move coming off HTF structue with nearby LTF structure. Again, context
<ul>
<li>eg. if there&rsquo;s a HTF support and LTF resistance $20 away, don&rsquo;t sell at resistance if it bounces off HTF support because it&rsquo;s probably going to steamroll LTF resistance</li>
<li>use LTF levels as an area to compound trade or check in on your trade</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="entry-triggers">Entry Triggers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#entry-triggers">#</a></h3>
<p>Very personal/subjective: market at candle closes, blind limits, market following reaction at level, one hit versus scaling in, etc.</p>
<p>Cred&rsquo;s opinions:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTF levels require more patience or, alternatively, can be given more time</li>
<li>No need to be entirely uniform in time frame selection, especially with regard to entries
<ul>
<li>Especially with ‘price action entries’ i.e. waiting for LTF evidence of strength/weakness at HTF levels</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>LTF closes at HTF levels are not particularly reliable; you could end up selling the bottom/buying the top eg.
<ul>
<li>if a weekly has a wick below the level, then there was probably a hourly/daily close below the level. That doesn&rsquo;t mean the level is invalidated</li>
<li>markets aren&rsquo;t perfect, wait until close of timeframe

</ul>
<h3 id="trade-management">Trade Management<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#trade-management">#</a></h3>
<p>Most subjective part, real answers will come from trading journal -&gt; managing a trade (and how) versus leaving original parameters as they were</p>
<p>Cred&rsquo;s opinions:</p>
<ul>
<li>beginners have a tendency to be impatient at levels and look for excuses to manage a trade, give your ideas a time to play out</li>
<li>being hand-offs in HTF trades is a skill in itself</li>
<li>manage on same time frame that it is derived from (or slightly different eg H1 setup, manage on 30M/1H)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important: Context &gt; structure</strong></p>
<p>Quick checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> What is the dominant trend (if any)?</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Have I mapped my HTF (and LTF) levels?</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Am I aware what type of level/structure price is coming from?</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Given the above, is my fade or continuation entry reasonable?</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> If yes, what are my entry criteria/parameters for engagement?</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> How do I now manage the position?</li>

<h2 id="8-mastering-rsi">8: Mastering RSI<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#8-mastering-rsi">#</a></h2>
<p>In bull/bear markets, it&rsquo;s not overly useful because it can stay overbought or oversold for a really long time</p>
<p><strong>RSI:</strong> Relative Strength Index</p>
<ul>
<li>momentum oscillator which emasures the speed and change of price movements</li>
<li>more valuable and accurate with more price data</li>
<li>you can change the period. Shorter the period, more sensitive RSI becomes and wider its amplitude</li>
<li><strong>oscillator:</strong> a technical analysis tool that constructs high and low bands between two extreme values, and then builds a trend indicator that fulctuates within these bounds</li>
</ul>
<p>Formula:<br>
RSI = 100 - (100/1+RS) where</p>
<p>RS = Average Gain/Average Loss<br>
Average Gain = [(previous Average Gain) x 13 + current Gain] / 14<br>
Average Loss =  [(previous Average Loss) x 13 + current Loss] / 14</p>
<p>Complete basics: an instrument is overbought when RSI is above 70 and oversold when RSI is below 30 (in bull markets, it becomes 80 and in bear markets, it becomes 20)</p>
<h3 id="trading-rsi">Trading RSI<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#trading-rsi">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>open long positions or close shorts when RSI crosses from below 30 to above 30 (bulls are stepping in)</li>
<li>open shorts or close longs when RSI crosses from above 70 to below 70</li>
<li>trade with the trend (if in a downtrend, sell the overbought with more confidence)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="midpoint-value-crosses">Midpoint Value Crosses<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#midpoint-value-crosses">#</a></h3>
<p>Three main uses (use on HTF like 4H and 1D):</p>
<ol>
<li>Indicate whether there’s a bullish or bearish bias in the trend (amount of time RSI spends above/below 50)</li>
<li>Indicate whether a trend reversal will happen (treat 50 as S/R)</li>
<li>Indicate periods of consolidation (cutting through both sides repeatedly)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="trendlines">Trendlines<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#trendlines">#</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Simply, identify the trend of the instrument</li>
<li>‘Confirm’ a breakout/breakdown of a pattern</li>
<li>Indicate trend reversals when RSI breaks resistance/support lines</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="divergences">Divergences<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#divergences">#</a></h3>
<p>A <strong>divergence</strong> is when the oscillator shows something different than what price is showing i.e. the oscillator does not follow price</p>
<p><strong>Bullish divergence:</strong> price makes lower low, indicator makes higher low<br>
<strong>Bearish divergence:</strong> price makes higher high, indicator makes lower high</p>
<p>Hidden bullish divergence: price makes higher low, indicator makes lower low<br>
Hidden bearish divergence: price makes lower high, indicator makes higher high</p>
<p>How to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a downtrend, to identify where bearish momentum is fading and pre-empting a trend reversal</li>
<li>In an uptrend, to identify where bullish momentum is fading and pre-empting a trend reversal</li>
<li>aka avoid buying the top or selling the bottom</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="failure-swings">Failure Swings<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#failure-swings">#</a></h3>
<p>A <strong>failure swing</strong> is when at the extreme values, RSI fails to make a higher high/lower low and reverses in the opposite direction</p>
<p>Two types:<br>
<strong>Top failure swing</strong> (peak in RSI over 70): fails to exceed previous peak in an uptrend and then breaks a previous bottom<br>
<strong>Bottom failure swing</strong> (bottom in RSI under 30): fails to set a new low and then breaks a previous top</p>
<p>Uses: same as divergence (avoid buying top or selling bottom and predicate trend reversal)</p>

<li>Reasonably aggressive, can sometimes be too tight if the candle that broke the level isn’t particularly big. If so, move a couple of candles back. Works best with a big (and ideally engulfing) candle</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Option 2: furthermost deviation
<ul>
<li>If bullish: lowest low made before the level was broken again</li>
<li>If bearish: highest high made before the level was broken again</li>
<li>Conservative, but won’t always give actionable R:R e.g. with rounded retests that made a lot of space</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Good level selection: clear, high time frame, violent and significant levels perform better than random highs/lows</li>
<li>Second break/break back through the level should be strong and fast: stronger/faster break = less time for those offside to mitigate = more traders trapped. Ideally some sort of engulfing candle</li>
<li>First/false break spikes into liquidity: provides a factor of confluence that the first move was a trap</li>
<li>Trend considerations
<ul>
<li>In an uptrend, bullish CDC setups are more likely to form and are higher probability
<ul>
<li>With the aim of bringing in shorts for long liquidity → upside continuation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In a downtrend, bearish CDC setups are more likely to form and are higher probability
<ul>
<li>With the aim of bringing in longs for short liquidity → downside continuation</li>
</ul>
