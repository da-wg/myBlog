[{"content":"Hey there and welcome to my blog! During my last online school term, I made a list of things that I wanted to learn during my coop term, when I would have a little bit of free time. Since there was a lot of overlapping topics, I wanted to document everything I learn so I could look back in the future. This blog is the result of that wish and will hopefully allow me to do that. There is also a small part of me that wishes to enter the crypto/investment field so this blog will also hopefully act as a sort of \u0026ldquo;resume\u0026rdquo; for the future.\nMost of the posts for the next couple of months will probably be me simply making notes straight from the videos and resources that I\u0026rsquo;m learning from. However, as time goes on, the goal is to start contributing insightful and critical posts about things that I notice.\nAlthough I intend to have this blog for a long time, I\u0026rsquo;ve only planned for the next calendar year. The goal is simple:\n make a butt load of money ($GME/$DOGE type money or bust) (very distant) learn a couple of things  Now onto a couple of administrative things:\nStructure:  categories will be the broad topics that the blog will be centered around (eg. crypto, trading, stocks, coding) series will be blog posts centered around a particular subsection within a category (eg. Bitcoin, altcoins, React)  There will also be an ongoing \u0026ldquo;book list\u0026rdquo; blog post which will be updated with what books I\u0026rsquo;m reading and any notes about the books I\u0026rsquo;ve finished.\nHow I created the website: The website was created using Hugo and the PaperMod theme and then hosted on GitHub Pages. The website/repos are listed here:\n Hugo this blog hugo-PaperMod  Copyright blah blah blah, feel free to clone this blog and make any changes you wish.\nAbout me: I\u0026rsquo;m a 20 yr old post-secondary student from Canada. I\u0026rsquo;ve been very interested in learning about investing and trading for a couple of years, but never really got into it. I was originally just looking to start investing in the stock market, but after seeing what happened with the stock market after the March crash and the subsequent \u0026ldquo;V-shaped\u0026rdquo; reversal due to the Fed pumping trillions into the market, I felt like the current financial system was no longer fair which led me to look for a solution.\nLuckily, I found it relatively quickly in Bitcoin and \u0026ldquo;The Bitcoin Standard\u0026rdquo; book. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve become sort of obsessed with the rate of innovation in the space and truly believe it will be the future of finance. I decided I would go \u0026ldquo;all-in\u0026rdquo; on crypto and not touch the stock market, out of principle.\nHowever, I recently realized that the result of this is that I\u0026rsquo;ve built my own bubble on Twitter (where I get the latest crypto and investing news) where everybody I see is pro-crypto, which is obviously detrimental to being able to think critical and objectively about crypto. On top of this, there are still plently of innovative, cutting-edge companies that I still want to invest in on the stock market. Therefore, this blog will still be based heavily around crypto, but there will be \u0026ldquo;traditional equities\u0026rdquo; as well.\n","permalink":"/posts/blog-init/","summary":"Hey there and welcome to my blog!
