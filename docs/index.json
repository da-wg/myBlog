[{"content":"Hey there and welcome to my blog! This blog will help document my journey into the more technical aspects of crypto and trading. Since discovering the world of Bitcoin and crypto 9 months ago, I\u0026rsquo;ve spent majority of my free time keeping up with the space. When I wasn\u0026rsquo;t studying, I was busy learning about new projects and \u0026ldquo;trading\u0026rdquo; on Uniswap. Today, I feel confident in my understanding of:\n the history and major dates of Bitcoin and Ethereum names of majority of the top 100 coins and what they are areas with the potential for greatest growth and innovation in 2021 and beyond (eg. DeFi, NFTs, Insurance) \u0026ldquo;Blue-chip\u0026rdquo; DeFi projects and basic understanding of their value proposition the hottest memes on crypto twitter (I personally think this is the most important)  However, I realized there are still various topics that I haven\u0026rsquo;t spent as much time on. These include:\n Technical aspects of defi protocols (eg. how SUSHI fees are generated and distributed, how RUNE is able to do cross-chain swaps vs atomic swaps, ALPHA leveraged lending) NFTs (eg. how they are able to verify ownership, what are the next logical \u0026ldquo;next steps\u0026rdquo; for projects in this space) Polkadot (eg. the ecosystem, where it excels vs Ethereum) Insurance (eg. how insurance works in the crypto world) Solidity  Since I learn better when I\u0026rsquo;m taking notes (it forces me to slow down and absorb the information), I thought a blog will allow me to document my learning as well as push me to be as thorough as possible when researching these topics. Eventually, this blog will hopefully also act as a \u0026ldquo;portfolio\u0026rdquo; of sorts, reflective of the time I\u0026rsquo;ve spent in this space, since I want to do a co-op work term in this field.\nMost of the posts for the next couple of months will simply be me making notes straight from the videos and resources that I\u0026rsquo;m learning from. However, as time goes on, the goal is to start contributing insightful and critical posts about things that I notice.\nAbout me: I\u0026rsquo;m a 20 year old post-secondary student from Canada. Like many others, I first learned about Bitcoin during its parabolic run in 2017 and even bought some near the peak. However, I never did any research into what I bought and viewed it simply as a \u0026ldquo;number go up\u0026rdquo; investment and so as the price plummeted in 2018, so did my interest in it.\nFast foward to 2020 and I began seriously looking into investing in the stock market for the first time right before COVID hit and the market crashed in March 2020 (I know, impeccable timing). The subsequent \u0026ldquo;V-shaped\u0026rdquo; reversal in the stock market and the massive stimulus cheques gave birth to many hilarious memes around the governmental role surrounding money (printer go brrr), but although I couldn\u0026rsquo;t put my finger on it, something about the whole situation didn\u0026rsquo;t feel right to me. At the same time, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know to look for alternatives because the system\u0026rsquo;s always been like this right? Governments control the money, banks are the middleman and they\u0026rsquo;ll never knowingly relinquish that power so what\u0026rsquo;s the point right? Oh boy.\nDuring that time, I watched a lot of Andrew Jikh\u0026rsquo;s videos since he seemed to recognize the same problems I saw in the stock market. However, it was one video in particular with Raoul Pal that started this journey, where he mentions Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. Huh? The last time I had heard about Bitcoin in any meaningful capacity was in late 2017 and never once was it mentioned in the same sentence as \u0026ldquo;inflation hedge\u0026rdquo;. I downloaded The Bitcoin Standard to read during my week off from school because it had sparked my interest and I wanted to learn more. I finished it in one day. It was the first time I was made aware of the history of money and the alternative ways of economic thinking. Before that book, I never knew why we needed a term for fiat money because I (naively) thought that money had always been in this form. Above all else, it made me question our current financial system and I became obsessed with expanding my knowledge in this area.\nThe author of the book, Saifedean Ammous, is known as a \u0026ldquo;Bitcoin maxi\u0026rdquo;, meaning he views other cryptos as nothing more than schemes to get people to sell their Bitcoin. As a result, I also developed tunnel vision around the crypto market with Bitcoin as the light and everything else being distractions. It took 2 months to even give Ethereum the light of day, but after finally looking into it and what it does, I was hooked. It probably helped that I entered during one of the more exciting times for the industry in recent history, later appropriately termed the \u0026ldquo;DeFi Summer\u0026rdquo;, but over the next 6 months I learned everything I could about every hot project coming out or taking over the spotlight. $YFI, $SUSHI, $UNI, $RUNE, $AAVE, $SNX (ASSY anybody?). I will probably make individual posts about all of them at some point, but with each one that I read about, the more convinced I became that decentralized finance could legitimately take over traditional finance.\nLooking back on it now, I was perhaps too excited about Bitcoin and the problems I thought it could solve. Bitcoin is not perfect and neither is any project in this space right now. In fact, there are many big issues ranging from Bitcoins\u0026rsquo;s PoW power consumption to Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s high gas fees (bUt iT mEaNs UsAgE). It definitely won\u0026rsquo;t transition the world into some utopia where everybody will suddenly become financially literate and nobody will ever worry about living paycheque to paycheque.\nHowever, this can also be viewed as an argument for how early we still are. I think the crypto industry as a whole will eventually fix these problems and can evolved into a much more equitable and fair financial system than our current system. Areas like DeFi make me excited for the future of this space. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m invested and why I believe it can become the future of finance (france, for the crypto twitter crowd). Exciting times to be in crypto.\nStructure:  categories will be the broad topics that the blog will be centered around (eg. crypto, trading, stocks, coding) series will be blog posts centered around a particular subsection within a category (eg. Bitcoin, altcoins, React)  There will also be an ongoing \u0026ldquo;book list\u0026rdquo; blog post which will be updated with what books I\u0026rsquo;m reading and any notes about the books I\u0026rsquo;ve finished.\nHow I created the website: The website was created using Hugo and the PaperMod theme and then hosted on GitHub Pages.

A great resource for learning Javascript is freeCodeCamp\u0026rsquo;s Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification course\n Lesson 1 Solidity\u0026rsquo;s code is encapsulated in contracts.\ncontract: fundamental building block of Ethereum applications - all variables and functions belong to a contract. Starting point of all your projects\npragma solidity: version of Solidity compiler you wish to use state variables - permanently stored in contract storage\nstructs: - objects\narrarys: - two types:\n fixed arrays: Person[2] fixedArrary; dynmaic arrays: Person[] people; public arrays: Solidity automatically create a getter method: Person[] public people; .push() to add to back of array  functions: - things to note:\n when passing in by reference, use memory start function parameter names with _ good practice to mark private as default (name private function starting with _) returns (string memory): return type view: view-only, no modifications (const in C++) pure: not access any data in the app (Solidity is good at telling you when to use view vs. pure)  keccak256: built in hash function. One purpose is for pseudo-random number generation. Note: not secure.\ntypecasting: converting between data types\nevents: way for your contract to communicate that something happened on the blockchain to your app front-end, which can be \u0026lsquo;listening\u0026rsquo; for certain events and take action when they happen. Web3.js: Javascript library for Ethereum that allows you to write a frontend that interacts with the contract.\npragma solidity \u0026gt;=0.5.0 \u0026lt;0.6.0; contract ZombieFactory { event NewZombie(uint zombieId, string name, uint dna); uint dnaDigits = 16; uint dnaModulus = 10 ** dnaDigits; struct Zombie { string name; uint dna; } Zombie[] public zombies; function _createZombie(string memory _name, uint _dna) private { uint id = zombies.push(Zombie(_name, _dna)) - 1; emit NewZombie(id, _name, _dna); } function _generateRandomDna(string memory _str) private view returns (uint) { uint rand = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_str))); return rand % dnaModulus; } function createRandomZombie(string memory _name) public { uint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name); _createZombie(_name, randDna); } }  Lesson 2 addresses: Owned by a specific user, we can use it as a unique ID for ownership (set to the Ethereum address that called the function)\nmapping: Key-value store for storing and looking up date (dictionaries)\nimport: same as import in Javascript\ninterface: used to interact with another contract on the blockchain (syntactically the same as interfaces in C++). Note: In Solidity, you can return more than one value from a function\nfunctions:\n msg.sender: address of the person (or smart contract) who called the current function. In Solidity, function execution always needs to start with an external caller so there will always be a msg.sender. Gives you security of the Ethereum blockchain (only way to modify somebody elses' data is to steal their private key) require: function stops executing if some condition is not true (like Racket error checking). Note: Solidity does not have native string comparison inheritance: same as inheritance in C++ storage vs. memory: storage is permanent, memory is temporary (eg. hard drive vs RAM or local vs global variable) internal and external:  internal is same as private, but accessible to contracts that inherit this contract external is like public, but functions can ONLY be called from outside the contract    zombiefactory.sol:\npragma solidity \u0026gt;=0.5.0 \u0026lt;0.6.0; contract ZombieFactory { event NewZombie(uint zombieId, string name, uint dna); uint dnaDigits = 16; uint dnaModulus = 10 ** dnaDigits; struct Zombie { string name; uint dna; } Zombie[] public zombies; mapping (uint =\u0026gt; address) public zombieToOwner; mapping (address =\u0026gt; uint) ownerZombieCount; function _createZombie(string memory _name, uint _dna) internal { uint id = zombies.push(Zombie(_name, _dna)) - 1; zombieToOwner[id] = msg.sender; ownerZombieCount[msg.sender]++; emit NewZombie(id, _name, _dna); } function _generateRandomDna(string memory _str) private view returns (uint) { uint rand = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_str))); return rand % dnaModulus; } function createRandomZombie(string memory _name) public { require(ownerZombieCount[msg.sender] == 0); uint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name); randDna = randDna - randDna % 100; _createZombie(_name, randDna); } } zombiefeeding.sol:\npragma solidity \u0026gt;=0.5.0 \u0026lt;0.6.0; import \u0026#34;./zombiefactory.sol\u0026#34;; contract KittyInterface { function getKitty(uint256 _id) external view returns ( bool isGestating, bool isReady, uint256 cooldownIndex, uint256 nextActionAt, uint256 siringWithId, uint256 birthTime, uint256 matronId, uint256 sireId, uint256 generation, uint256 genes ); } contract ZombieFeeding is ZombieFactory { address ckAddress = 0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d; KittyInterface kittyContract = KittyInterface(ckAddress); function feedAndMultiply(uint _zombieId, uint _targetDna, string memory _species) public { require(msg.sender == zombieToOwner[_zombieId]); Zombie storage myZombie = zombies[_zombieId]; _targetDna = _targetDna % dnaModulus; uint newDna = (myZombie.dna + _targetDna) / 2; if(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_species)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked(\u0026#34;kitty\u0026#34;))) { newDna = newDna - newDna % 100 + 99; } _createZombie(\u0026#34;NoName\u0026#34;, newDna); } function feedOnKitty(uint _zombieId, uint _kittyId) public { uint kittyDna; (,,,,,,,,,kittyDna) = kittyContract.getKitty(_kittyId); feedAndMultiply(_zombieId, kittyDna, \u0026#34;kitty\u0026#34;); } }  Lesson 3 After you deploy a contract, it\u0026rsquo;s immutable, meaning it can never be modified or updated again. If there\u0026rsquo;s a flaw in your contract code, there\u0026rsquo;s no way for you to patch it later. You would have to tell your users to start using a different smart contract address that has the fix. Because of this, it is often smart to have a function that allows up to change addresses that rely on external dependencies, in case something happens to those contracts in the future.\nOwnable: contracts that give owners special privileges:\n modifiers: executes before the main function gets executed (mostly used to add require checks). onlyOwner: only the owner can call the function OpenZeppelin: library of secure and community-vetted smart contracts that you can use in your own DApps.  Gas:\n how much gas is required to execute a function depends on how complex the function\u0026rsquo;s logic is, based on how much computing resources will be required to perform that operation (eg. writing to storage is much more expensive than adding two ints) total gas cost is the sum of the gas costs of all its individual operations code optimization is much more important in Ethereum than any other programming language because there is a real cost to users in structs, using smaller-sized uint will allow Solidity to pack these variables together to take up less storage. You also want to cluster identical data types together.  Time Units:\n now: unix timestamp of latest block Solidity also has seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, years as default   ","permalink":"/posts/cryptozombies/","summary":"CryptoZombies\u0026rsquo;s Website\n Note: I already have a little bit of programming experience so I will be relating some of the concepts to Javascript/C++ concepts.

Why would somebody do this?\n don\u0026rsquo;t want to sell their tokens delay or avoid capital gain taxes increase leverage  collateral factor: determines how much can be borrowed based on the quality of the collateral (eg. DAI and ETH is 0.75)\n when borrowing, borrowed amount must stay below their collateral times collateral factor if it goes lower, they will have their loan liquidated  interest APY - calculated per Ethereum block (meaning variable APY)\nSidenote: Seems like an obvious limitation of def; a variable APY that\u0026rsquo;s ever-changing and volatile requires people to constantly check in on their APY to ensure they don\u0026rsquo;t get liquidated (AAVE\u0026rsquo;s stable APY is average of last 30 days which is still relatively short). For long investments, like mortgage, there has to be a way to have a long-term stable APY\nExample:\n User deposits 10ETH in Compound, gets a certain number of CETH in return based on exchange rate (eg. new market set to 0.02) CETH then accumulates interest with each ETH block (exchange rate increases depending on supply APY) AAVE is similar except ATokens are pegged to underlying tokens at 1:1   Liquidity Pools Traditional stock and crypto exchanges (eg. Coinbase and Binance) use an order-book model:\n bidders try to buy for as low as possible while seller try to sell for as high as possible. They then converge on a price Market makers: entities who are willing to sell at a particular price (buy order, sell order). Without market makers, exchange instantly becomes illiquid  Order-book models in DeFi:\n this type of exchange is not replicated in DeFi because it would be slow, expensive and have poor UI/UX Ethereum has throughput of 12-15 transactions per second and 10-19s block times. Not viable for the mass quantities of every-changing orders on traditional exchanges. It also has a gas fee for every interaction with a smart contract so market makers would go bankrupt second layer solutions also don\u0026rsquo;t work because of liquidity issues and transactions required to be sent in \u0026amp; out of 2nd layer  Liquidity Pools: Pools of tokens that are locked in smart contracts\n each pool holds two tokens, creating a new market for that pair (eg. DAI/ETH) first LP for a pool sets the initial price for the assets. there is an incentive for first LP and every LP afterwards to provide equal value of both tokens to prevent an arbitrage opportunity LPs get LP tokens back in proportion to how much they provided to the pool each trade has a 0.3% fee which gets proportionally distributed to all LP token holders Deterministic Algorithm/Automated Market Maker: mechanism that adjusts price after every trade according to a deterministic algorithm  Price is determined by ratio of the tokens. Price impact (slippage) determined by two factors:\n size of the trade how much liquidity is in the pool (why some protocols like BAL started incentivizing LPs by giving them extra tokens. This is called liquidity mining)  Uniswap: Constant Product Market Maker calculation: x * y = k\n product of quantities of two tokens (x and y) remains the same (k) in this method, Uniswap can provide liquidity no matter how large the trade because the algorithm asymptotically increases the price as quantity demanded increases  Balancer: as many as 8 tokens in a pool\nCurve: realized AMM doesn\u0026rsquo;t work well for assets that should have similar prices (eg. stablecoins and different versions of synthetics like SETH and WETH)\n offers lower fees and lower slippage when exchanging these tokens   Impermanent Loss Temporary loss of funds when providing liquidity. Difference between holding asset and providing liquidity\nObserved when LP has to provide both sides of the pool in correct ratio and rely on arbitrage to ensure the prices reflect real world prices\nRefer to example in video, very clear\nWhat are the incentives for LPs?\n Fees (0.3% on every trade for Uniswap). In order to be profitable, impermanent loss \u0026lt; collected fees liquidity mining: rewarding LPs with extra tokens  Pools other than Uniswap:\n Curve: pools have very little impermanent loss because they only hold tokens that should be very similar or the same in value with the other. In general, stable pools will attract more liquidity Balancer: arbitrary weights in pool. LPs can have high exposure to a certain asset by providing much higher weights.

This will be unique depending on the setup  Risk Per Trade \u0026amp; Position Size Risk per trade: what percentage of total equity a trader stands to lose per trade\n most traders trade within 2-3% of equity per trade\nCalculation: total equity * risk % does NOT mean a trader buys units worth that amount eg. if a trader risks $300, that means if the trader gets stopped out, they lose $300  Position size: the number of units of an instrument a trader purchases. Two pieces of information:\n risk per trade distance to stop loss from entry in percentage (%) terms\ncalculation: (total equity * risk %)/ distance to stop loss from entry most platforms have calculators  R \u0026amp; Win Rate R/risk-reward ratio: number which reflects the amount of risk undertaken relative to the reward of a trade\ncalculation: reward/risk\n no gold standard R again, based on technical analysis. Also means targets should be realistics TradingView has a calculator  Win rate: % which reflects how many of a trader\u0026rsquo;s total trades are winning trades over a given period of time calculation: (winning trades/total trades) * 100\n Traders often split into two camps  higher R lower win rate setups lower R higher win rate setups   using average R, you can calculate the minimum win rate they must meet in order to be profitable calculation: 1/(1 + R) * 100`  Edgewonk Cheat Sheet\nEvolving R: the R of a trade is static upon entry, but as price moves away from entry, the R of the trade evolves and changes\n eg. price follows your thesis, misses your target by 1-2 points and then comes all the way back and stops you out for breakeven. recalculate R if it seems like the trade is changing  Handling Drawdown idea that the market will, at some point, hand your ass to you is just about the only certainity in trading\nMake sure a losing streak will not wipe you out: Potential drawdown mitigation checklist:\n Can your win rate and R take a losing streak on the chin? See table 2. Do you have trading rules/some sort of system for taking trades? Or are you gambling? Have you been following your trading rules? What links your losing trades? What links your winning trades? Do you simply need a break? Are you punting FOMO/revenge trades? Have you considered reducing your risk and increasing the quality of setups you take?  Margin Margin: borrowing capital from your borker to open a position larger than one would other be able to\n Cross margin: your entire available balance will be used to avoid liquidation (aka liquidation = your entire account gets nuked) isolated margin: fixed margin for a certain position (aka liquidation = balance used to open position gets nuked) Liquidations: the price at which your losses are such that the exchanges will forcibly close your position  Position size calculation does not change\n risk must still be the same   3: Order Flow market tend to make a lot more sense once you get into the mindsset of institutional order flow\nProblems Institutional Traders Face\n trading a lot of size, there are issues with slippage and front running (dedicated people looking for your asks/bids and not letting you get filled eg. ladder, order book, chart) how do institutional traders get around this issue? By engineering liquidity  Liquidity Longs = short liquidity (what do you need to go long? -\u0026gt; shorts) Shorts = long liquidity (what do you need to go short? -\u0026gt; longs)\nGoing back to institutional trader dilemma:\n if you want sellers, you make the market look like it\u0026rsquo;s going to shit itself if you want buyers, you make the market look like it\u0026rsquo;s going to go vertical  Liquidity Pools: areas where there are likely to be a lot of limit orders/stops\n pending limit orders = untapped liquidity, which is released/triggered by price trading through a certain area how to identify liquidity pools? simple test: where are retail traders taught to put their stops?  below swing lows above swing highs above range highs below range lows   how to filter probable liquidity pools from less probable liquidity pools?  Deep swing highs/lows → ones that stand out on the chart as swing points Swing points visible on the higher time frames tend to work better because more traders see them → more orders build up above/below them (Cred checks 15M, 1H, 1D) Extended consolidation ranges (orders on both sides of the range; traders trying to catch the breakout) HTF highs and lows (1D, 1W, even 1M) Equal highs/lows Always ask yourself: where are retail traders’ stops resting?    Stop Hunting Stop Hunting: where price trades through an area where retail stops were resting before\n example of how a market takes out a low/\u0026ldquo;break support\u0026rdquo; before proceeding higher. Two forms of stops:  stop losses of those who are long. When triggered, turn into market orders to sell limit order of those who are waiting to short. When triggered, turn into market order to sell The result is sell orders flood the market, creating engineered long liquidity. Institutions can find retail traders to buy from. Then they take the market higher In fact, sometimes institutional players will sometimes sell in order to force the market to go down, even if they want to long, because they know if they take out a specific low, there is a ton of liquidity that they can pick up   retail traders' stops create the liquidity pools for the institutional traders this is often why markets will take out a low before going vertical or take out a high before falling off a cliff. How do you distinguish? You can\u0026rsquo;t with 100% accuracy, which is why it works, but there are things you can do:  If possible, avoid putting your stops (both stop losses and limit orders) at obvious liquidity pool targets as discussed earlier Monitor the price action: if the move is a stop run, price will often give you a reaction when it takes out the high/low (tall wicks, slow down in momentum, failure to close above/below on a HTF, etc.) If you’re waiting for a clean break:  Clean HTF candle close through the level e.g. H1/H4 Safer: wait for the breakdown + bid/offer the retest   Divergence Keeping a trading journal    Sidenote: this probably happens more right before big moves. There\u0026rsquo;s probably leading indicators for big moves, like when you could see somebody was consistently buying over weeks (which turned out to be Saylor buying his BTC through Coinbase OTC). Obviously, he\u0026rsquo;s not a trader but there\u0026rsquo;s probably data that would indicate institutions are active in the markets.\n 4: Horizontal Support/Resistance  Art form, not a science when drawing levels Don\u0026rsquo;t try to force levels where they\u0026rsquo;re not clear - highest probability setups will come from clear setups that are worth waiting for  TradingView tips:\n horizontal line tool (Alt/Option+H) Magnet mode (snap) changing visibility so that lines are only visible on certain time frames  Resistance: area where we expect price to have a hard time going higher\nSupport: area where we expect price to have a hard time going lower\nTwo on the right on S/R flips:\nPrinciple 1 - S/R Flips S/R levels flip when broken by price\n A support level that is broken = resistance A resistance level that is broken = support  broken: a clean candle close through the level\nPrinciple 2 - Recurring Tests The more a level is test by price from the same direction, the weaker it becomes\n Think of it as more buyers/sellers getting absorbed with each test until eventually, during the nth time, there\u0026rsquo;s not enough buyers/sellers to hold that level and it breaks  However, it becomes strong if/when the S/R flips\nPrinciple 3 - First Test Best Test Corollary of Principle 2: the highest probability level trade is the first test of a broken from the other side\n first test of a broken resistance level (expected support) first test of a broken support level (expected resistance)  Strong Level Criteria  High number of touches (once the level has been broken)  More touches from the same direction = weaker level as buyers/sellers absorbed But once the level is broken and price is on the other side, it is fresh   Violent touches (once the level has been broken)  Violence = how strongly price reacted upon testing the level More violence i.e. bigger swings away = better   Based on recent price action  Extremely important so you don’t use levels that were good in the past but have now been washed Read the chart from right to left Interested in what recent market participants are doing   Long duration (once the level has been broken)  Levels that were respected as S/R for longer tend to be stronger E.g. level that was resistance for several weeks is likely to be a stronger support (when broken) than a level that was resistance for only a few hours    Drawing tip: candle closes/body doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter, but refine your level by making sure it is hinged on the most recent lows before break downwards/most recent highs before break upwards\nTrading the Inverse: buying broken resistance \u0026amp; selling broken support\nTypes of Retests Two types of retests:\n Micro retests: lower time frames, occur virtually immediately after a level is broken. Lower probability Rounded retests: higher time frame, time and space between break and retest. Higher probability  Time Frames HTF are more reliable, but are way less frequent so you have to balance between quality and quantity\n Cred uses H1 and D1 time frames   5: Market Structure Not a canonical view (if such a thing exists)\nDefining Market Structure Sequence of (proximate) highs and lows in a given instrument\nSequence\n Bullish MS = higher highs and higher lows bearish MS = lower highs and lower lows  Swing Low: low with a HL on both sides Swing high: high with a LH on both sides\nConsider:\n recency significance of move following that high/low what\u0026rsquo;s the obvious/most outstanding high/low?  if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like a clear swing point from first glance, it likely won\u0026rsquo;t be the best structure    Note: Can be complimented with trends eg. HTF bull trend sees a LTF MSB = opportunity to dip buy etc.\nSelecting highs/low as MS anchors\n  use S/R as starting point\n  is the swing high/low confluent with another key level (eg. S/R, candle open)\n  focus on swing points that are visible and significant to the largest number of participants (low hanging fruit)\n  No unified MS per time frame\n  Don\u0026rsquo;t chase every MSB (sometimes it is a weak signal in an overridingly strong trend). Don\u0026rsquo;t become a breakout/breakdown chaser under the guise of MS\n  Identifying Breaks in Market Structure A shift in the sequence of highs/lows in the opposite direction\n bullish MSB: sequence of LH violated by the HH bearish MSB: sequence of HL violated by a LL  There are different definitions, this is just Cred\u0026rsquo;s (if it\u0026rsquo;s good enough for Cred, it\u0026rsquo;s good enough for me)\nCandle bodies vs wicks: doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, just be consistent.\n Variant that Cred uses: Bodies for MS and closes above/below for MSB Other variants:  Wicks for MS and wicks above/below for MSB Wicks for MS and closes above/below for MSB   You\u0026rsquo;ll know a good breakout if you see one. If a breakout depends on looking at wicks vs bodies, it\u0026rsquo;s probably not that good/clearcut of a breakout  Times Frames:\n next section! generally, break has to occur in same time frame as the MS anchor  Directional bias shift in direction of the MSB\n Bullish MSB = Anticipating another HH (with or without a HL) = Bullish outlook, favouring long-side trades Bearish MSB: Anticipating another LL (with or without another LH) = Bearish outlook, favouring short-side trades (or staying out/taking profit/hedging etc. if long-only)  If trading counter-trend in MSB: You have to be more defensive cause you\u0026rsquo;re going against the trend\n Counter-trend trades: Shorter holding periods More conservative targets/FTA Greater minimum R:R requirements (usually with closer invalidation, not wider targets) More active trade management Different sizing (smaller/more conservative) don\u0026rsquo;t let winners \u0026ldquo;run\u0026rdquo; (generally do this more when you\u0026rsquo;re with a trend, not against)  Trading in direction of trend:\n Flip these around when trading in the direction of the MSB (or trend more broadly)  Using market structure to filter good S/R:\naka Ask what the level achieved (it broke market sturcture)\n Resistance (high) that preceded a bearish MSB (lower low) is strong resistance Support (low) that preceded a bullish (MSB) higher high is strong support  MSB as entry triggers:\nBasic premise:\n Bearish MSB at resistance for sell setups Bullish MSB at support for buy setups  Time frame:\n High time frame (Weekly/Daily) structure as an area to do business Low time frame (Hourly/M15 etc.) MSB as the trigger for the trade This time frame logic is often scaled down e.g. M5-M15 MSB at intraday levels etc.  Confirmation: much easier said than done!\n Often a trade-off: good confirmation and shite entry versus little/no confirmation and great entry  May create a poor habit of only entering a market once it moves (significantly) in your favour (DON\u0026rsquo;T DO THIS)   Cred\u0026rsquo;s Approach:  Daily market structure at Weekly levels (Or just using daily market structure on its own when the market is between levels and/or for LTF trading)    Trading Breaks in Market Structure Trades where you are reacting after the fact\nThree setups:\n Continuation from MS level/anchor  Bullish MSB requires HH. The long trade is taken on a pullback to the broken high. Bearish MSB requires LL. The short trade is taken on a pullback to the broken low. textbook S/R Identify MS → Identify MSB → Trade taken on a retest of Step 1\nInvalidation: Failing to flip the MS level (to support if bullish/to resistance if bearish)    2. Continuation from pullback level\n Bullish MSB requires HH. Continuation trade is taken below the breakout point but above the most recent low. Bearish MSB requires LL. Continuation trade is taken above the breakdown point but below the most recent high. reasoning: breaking and waiting until it forms a HL (for bullish) not as clean as the first, but hey that\u0026rsquo;s life  The MSB is an impulsive move. The market may continue the impulse (Setup 1) or retrace the impulse before continuing (Setup 2).   where to look for retracement? Fibonacci retracement (lesson 7 below)  R:R consideration: The deeper price reaches into the pullback area, the superior the R:R\n This is because deeper pullback = closer to invalidation however, like always, depends on context  Reversal   focus on trading opposite of a MSB once certain conditions are met  MSB failed to offer continuation. Failed continuation is suggestive of reversal   reasoning:  HH = Bullish / LL = Bearish Invalidation = LL / Invalidation = HH HH into LL = Bulls offside / LL into HH = Bears offside Bulls offside = Sell setup / Bears offside = Buy setup    Always seek to exert pressure on those weakest in the market\nDisclaimers: don\u0026rsquo;t actively look for trades or force something on the market (especially relevant when you\u0026rsquo;re first learning something)\n you can do everything correctly and still lose money Don’t take ‘cut and reverse’ as a given (good bearish setups that fail are bullish and vice versa)  Sometimes you just have the wrong read/identified a shitty time and place to do business   Harder parts of setups is sizing, execution, management, choosing targets etc. → all separate videos/articles!  Nuances Time Frame\n HTF will result in larger breaks and longer moves, LTF will result in smaller breaks and smaller moves lower time frame MSB does not cancel a HTF dominant trend  Market Structure in a Range\n In less volatile conditions, less obvious/shorter-term MSB can be pure noise/chop Best practice is to focus on MSB at the extremities of the range rather than chasing every HH/LL at the range midpoint  Slowdown/early signs of reversal\n One of the key benefits of MS is that it gives a lot of weight to recency. This can provide early hints of trend reversal or a slowdown more generally Be cognisant of shifts in behaviour when a dominant trend (or MS) is intact  Bullish example: Clear lower highs and lower lows starting to form equal/higher lows Bearish example: Clear higher highs and higher lows starting to form equal/lower highs   waiting for a clear signal is often too late   6: Time Frames Managing Expectation Trying to answer the question: what can be reasonably expected from price at a level on a given time frame?\nBasic principles\n High time frame (“HTF”) trends are longer and harder to reverse Bigger moves more likely to originate from HTF levels (or intraday levels formed at/within HTF levels) Price can take more time to resolve at HTF levels  Time Frame Selection  even for LTF traders, mapping HTF levels is useful  just because you don\u0026rsquo;t draw a level doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it stops existing (avoid getting smacked by an \u0026ldquo;invisible force\u0026rdquo; that ends up being just a HTF structure)   you don\u0026rsquo;t need to \u0026ldquo;choose\u0026rdquo; just one time frame, depends on context  Ascertaining trend/deriving directional bias Delineating levels Engaging the market/entry triggers Managing the trade The above do not have to be uniform when with regard to time frames    Trend Precedence/Market Structure always more than one trend at any given time on an instrument\nQuestion to ask: what is the dominant trend and what intraday conditions would allow for positioning in tandem with the trend?\nGeneral Principles:\n  Dominant trend is most reliably derived from HTF charts (Monthly/Weekly/Daily)\n  If a dominant trend is present on HTF then persuasive signs of reversal must also form on HTF\n I.e. not buying every green H1 candle in a weekly downtrend    HTF trends last longer than LTF trends (self-evident but easily forgotten)\n  LTF moves against dominant trend are counter-trend trading (fading) opportunities until proven otherwise (when you have a minor move you can either: 1. be an idiot and say \u0026ldquo;this time it\u0026rsquo;s different\u0026rdquo; and try to catch the bottom/top of reversal or 2. assume it\u0026rsquo;s just a retracement before continuing the dominant trend)\n  fading: stepping in when you see a minor retracement in an anticipation of trend continuation\n  sometimes you will be wrong and it will be a reversal, but it\u0026rsquo;s still better to assume (better to catch most of the move and lose 1 then lose most and win 1)\n  HTF bearish = broken support likely to turn resistance + selling rallies\n  HTF bullish = broken resistance likely to turn support + buying dips\n  same price behaviour, but depending on context (bullish vs bearish dominant trends) can mean completely different things\nRefining \u0026amp; Contextualising Levels common stumbling point: drawing every single level on a chart from a multitude of time frames\nRefining:\n Delineate HTF level (silly as it may sound, use a thick line and different colour)  Simplest way: lowest candle close preceding rally (support)/highest candle close preceding a decline (resistance)   Find LTF levels in reasonable proximity to the zone Can elect to keep the refined LTF level, keep only HTF level, make a zone/box, and so on → guide/filter   expectation to keep in mind is that a HTF structure, if it does its job, will steamroll LTF structure so don\u0026rsquo;t try to fade every move coming off HTF structue with nearby LTF structure. Again, context  eg. if there\u0026rsquo;s a HTF support and LTF resistance $20 away, don\u0026rsquo;t sell at resistance if it bounces off HTF support because it\u0026rsquo;s probably going to steamroll LTF resistance use LTF levels as an area to compound trade or check in on your trade    Entry Triggers Very personal/subjective: market at candle closes, blind limits, market following reaction at level, one hit versus scaling in, etc.\nCred\u0026rsquo;s opinions:\n HTF levels require more patience or, alternatively, can be given more time No need to be entirely uniform in time frame selection, especially with regard to entries  Especially with ‘price action entries’ i.e. waiting for LTF evidence of strength/weakness at HTF levels   LTF closes at HTF levels are not particularly reliable; you could end up selling the bottom/buying the top eg.  if a weekly has a wick below the level, then there was probably a hourly/daily close below the level. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean the level is invalidated markets aren\u0026rsquo;t perfect, wait until close of timeframe     Trade Management Most subjective part, real answers will come from trading journal -\u0026gt; managing a trade (and how) versus leaving original parameters as they were\nCred\u0026rsquo;s opinions:\n beginners have a tendency to be impatient at levels and look for excuses to manage a trade, give your ideas a time to play out being hand-offs in HTF trades is a skill in itself manage on same time frame that it is derived from (or slightly different eg H1 setup, manage on 30M/1H)  Important: Context \u0026gt; structure\nQuick checklist:\n What is the dominant trend (if any)? Have I mapped my HTF (and LTF) levels? Am I aware what type of level/structure price is coming from? Given the above, is my fade or continuation entry reasonable? If yes, what are my entry criteria/parameters for engagement? How do I now manage the position?   7: Fibonacci Levels Subjective; this video covers the basics\n50%/0.5 isn\u0026rsquo;t a Fibonacci number but is an important retracement level nonetheless\nSetting Up TradingView: third from the top and then halfway down the dropdown\nSettings: Fibonacci Anchor Selection - Which Highs/Low to Pick Swing High: a high + lower high on both sides Swing Low: a low + higher low on low on both sides\nWicks or candle bodies? Cred uses the wick\nWhich specific swing high/low is a good place for an anchor?\n the good ones tend to be the obvious ones, deep/obvious/stand out swings → ones which your eye is drawn to Remember institutional order flow lesson: which swing high/low will entice traders? valid across all time frames  Using Fib Levels to Identify Support/Entries Premise: using Fib levels to identify where price may retrace to after moving up\nHow:\n Identify the base of the rally - a swing low Identify the peak of the rally - a swing high/self-evident ‘top’ Select your Fibonacci retracement tool Click 1: swing low Click 2: swing high Fibonacci levels will appear  Using Fib Levels to Identify Resistance/Targets  Identify the peak of the rally - a swing high Identify the bottom of the move down - a swing low Select your Fibonacci retracement tool Click 1: swing high Click 2: swing low Fibonacci levels will appear  Using Fib Levels to Identify Resistance/Targets at ATH Premise: using Fibonacci levels to identify plausible targets/resistance when price is at ATH\n Identify a significant swing high AND/OR ATH Identify a significant swing low AND/OR ATL Click 1: the high Click 2: the low Fibonacci levels, including extension (1.XXX/2.XXX et cetera) levels, will appear  Advanced Concept One can also use the same Fibonacci setup to set targets if price finds support/resistance at a Fibonacci level by using negative fibs. However, take some profits at 0 in case it fails to break out\nHow Cred uses Fibonacci Levels  Mapping 1D Fibonacci levels based on big moves/deep swings Confluence only → I never trade a Fibonacci level on its own  because how do you know which fib/negative fib level to use? Depends on your other S/R levels   I pay the most attention to .382/.5/.618 Fibonacci levels   8: Mastering RSI In bull/bear markets, it\u0026rsquo;s not overly useful because it can stay overbought or oversold for a really long time\nRSI: Relative Strength Index\n momentum oscillator which emasures the speed and change of price movements more valuable and accurate with more price data you can change the period. Shorter the period, more sensitive RSI becomes and wider its amplitude oscillator: a technical analysis tool that constructs high and low bands between two extreme values, and then builds a trend indicator that fulctuates within these bounds  Formula:\nRSI = 100 - (100/1+RS) where\nRS = Average Gain/Average Loss\nAverage Gain = [(previous Average Gain) x 13 + current Gain] / 14\nAverage Loss = [(previous Average Loss) x 13 + current Loss] / 14\nComplete basics: an instrument is overbought when RSI is above 70 and oversold when RSI is below 30 (in bull markets, it becomes 80 and in bear markets, it becomes 20)\nTrading RSI  open long positions or close shorts when RSI crosses from below 30 to above 30 (bulls are stepping in) open shorts or close longs when RSI crosses from above 70 to below 70 trade with the trend (if in a downtrend, sell the overbought with more confidence)  Midpoint Value Crosses Three main uses (use on HTF like 4H and 1D):\n Indicate whether there’s a bullish or bearish bias in the trend (amount of time RSI spends above/below 50) Indicate whether a trend reversal will happen (treat 50 as S/R) Indicate periods of consolidation (cutting through both sides repeatedly)  Trendlines  Simply, identify the trend of the instrument ‘Confirm’ a breakout/breakdown of a pattern Indicate trend reversals when RSI breaks resistance/support lines  Divergences A divergence is when the oscillator shows something different than what price is showing i.e. the oscillator does not follow price\nBullish divergence: price makes lower low, indicator makes higher low\nBearish divergence: price makes higher high, indicator makes lower high\nHidden bullish divergence: price makes higher low, indicator makes lower low\nHidden bearish divergence: price makes lower high, indicator makes higher high\nHow to use:\n In a downtrend, to identify where bearish momentum is fading and pre-empting a trend reversal In an uptrend, to identify where bullish momentum is fading and pre-empting a trend reversal aka avoid buying the top or selling the bottom  Failure Swings A failure swing is when at the extreme values, RSI fails to make a higher high/lower low and reverses in the opposite direction\nTwo types:\nTop failure swing (peak in RSI over 70): fails to exceed previous peak in an uptrend and then breaks a previous bottom\nBottom failure swing (bottom in RSI under 30): fails to set a new low and then breaks a previous top\nUses: same as divergence (avoid buying top or selling bottom and predicate trend reversal)\n 9: Ichimoku Cloud Setup: In tradingview, go into indicators and click ichimoku cloud\n adjusted settings for crypto (b/c it\u0026rsquo;s 24/7 market) and then double to get more conservative signals: 20/60/120/30  Finding S/R:\n kumo cloud kijun sen tenkan sen incorporated with other trend lines/levels/patterns etc.  Ichimoku Cloud Trading Strategies Time Frames: 30M, 1H, 4H, 1D. Higher = stronger and less noise\n  Tenkan-Kijun Cross (TK Cross): when the Tenkan Sen (conversion line) crosses above or below the Kijun Sen (Base line)\n When Tenkan (blue) crosses from below to above cherry line, it\u0026rsquo;s bullish When it crosses from above to below, it\u0026rsquo;s bearish  Quality of signal depends on where it is in reference to the Kumo Cloud:\n Bullish TK cross above the Kumo = strong bullish signal, whereas the same TK cross below the Kumo only signals to close shorts (combining TK Cross with Kumo Breakout) Bearish TK cross inside the Kumo is a neutral bearish signal, whereas the same TK cross below the Kumo would be a strong sell signal     Kumo Breakout  when price breaks up through the top of the Kumo Cloud = bullish when price breaks down below the last line of the Kumo Cloud = bearish when price is within the cloud, this is a no-trade zone for Cred with the exception of an edge-to-edge (next)     Kumo Edge-To-Edge: if price enters the cloud and stays there, there\u0026rsquo;s a reasonable chance that price reaches the opposite end of the cloud especially if the opposite line is flat   Kijun Bounce: when price retraces to the Kijun Sen and successfully uses it as support level   Kijun Cross  when price crosses from below to above the cherry line, it\u0026rsquo;s a bullish signal when price crosses from above to below the cherry line, it\u0026rsquo;s bearish      Kumo Twists/Senkou Span Cross\n If you want to buy, look for future Kumo to be green If you want to sell, look for the future Kumo to be red    Ichimoku as an Oscillator/TK disequilibrium: the greater the disparity between the Kijun Sen and the Tenkan Sen, the more overbought/oversold the price is (depending on the trend)\n   10: Entry Triggers  Not exhaustive entry triggers Not a one-size-fits-all approach  Limit Orders: an order to buy/sell an instrument at a specific price (or better)\n Limit Sell: sell at/above market Limit Buy: buy at/below market  Pros: usually cheaper exchange fees\nCons: fills not guaranteed. As a result, stop loss orders must always be market orders\nMarket Orders: an order to buy/sell an instrument at the best possible price that is available immediately\nPro: guarantees full size execution/fill, instant\nCons: more expensive exchange fees, slippage\nLimit Orders Entries  BPC (Break Pullback Continuation): limit buy at a structure immediately after break upwards/limit sell at a structure immediately after a break downwards. Essentially break-and-retest strategy  Cons: more attention to lower time frames, low probability of working      Rounded Retest: limit buy at a structure after break upwards with time and space/limit sell at a structure after a break downwards with time and space\n Pros: higher probability, higher time frame Cons: tunnel vision/easier to lose sight of context, easier to \u0026ldquo;forget\u0026rdquo; about the trade     Conditionals: limit buys below old lows in bullish conditions/limit sells above old highs in bearish conditions\n hardest one, Cred doesnt use it at all. Pros: minimal drawdown Cons: stop placements not always clear, not always intuitive to choose which highs/lows will be run if stops have built up e.g. diagonal trend    Market Orders Entries  Market Structure: market buy at support if low time frames are breaking upwards/market sell at resistance if low time frames are breaking downwards. Discretionary for when you step in, just look for evidence  hard, not recommended for beginners Pros: more likely to avoid trades where the structure gets completely smashed (eg. rounded retest) Cons: likely to miss trades if you\u0026rsquo;re not immediate, may take a while to play out, takes lots of discipline to trade intraday market structure at HTF levels.     Candle Close: market buy after bullish candle close at support/market sell after bearish candle close at resistance  Pros: more likely to avoid trades where the structure gets completely smashed (eg. rounded retest), easy to backtest and journal Cons: poor R/R if very strong reaction at the structure     Momentum: market buy after key resistance smashed/market sell after key support smashed on a closing basis  Premium: markets don\u0026rsquo;t always retrace/retest levels Pros: catch impulsive moves that don\u0026rsquo;t retrace Cons: can form bad habit of chasing the market, study the market you trade to see if there\u0026rsquo;s a need for momentum trading Checklist:  good reason to think price will move higher/lower clear invalidation clear target actionable R:R → trade can be taken in ‘no man’s land’ at market       Acceptance: market buy on consecutive candle closes above resistance/market sell on consecutive candle closes below support  Pros: doesn\u0026rsquo;t require precision entries or require much time babysitting the charts Cons: needs patience, takes a while to play out     11: Support/Resistance Trade Setup (Clean Double Close/CDC)  Specific S/R setup that Cred trades  Immediate vs Rounded\n Immediate: price closes back below resistance/above support in the next candle* Rounded: price runs away having broken the level but fails on the eventual retest of the level  Bullish Clean Double Close:\n Support level forms Price closes below the level When price next trades to the level, it closes above it impulsively Crucially: there must be no touches/retests in between  Bearish Clean Double Close\n Resistance level forms Price closes above the level When price next trades to the level, it closes below it impulsively Crucially: there must be no touches/retests in between  Structure:\n The level must be cleanly broken both ways but especially on the second break i.e. the trap There must be no retest/wick/interaction of any kind between break 1 and break 2 no variant better than the others  Time Frames:\n HTF are superior, especially daily  Entry Triggers  Option 1: market order on candle close through the level  Clear trigger but some discretion as to whether the break is impulsive enough Aggressive Can be inactionable in terms of R:R if price closed too far from the level   Option 2: limit order at the broken level once candle has closed through it  Clearest trigger Conservative Can assess in advance whether the setup is actionable or not Risk of not being filled/price not pulling back (This is normal in trading)   Option 3: market order at the broken level once price retests it following the break  Most discretionary trigger If your trading style deals well with reactions at a level, you’ll probably do this anyway Harder to track    Stop Placement Whichever you employ: make sure your stop doesn’t land at an S/R level → always check!\nContext is very important here and will usually dictate which is more appropriate\n Option 1: thrust candle stop  If bullish: stop below the candle that broke the level the second time If bearish: stop above the candle that broke the level the second time Reasonably aggressive, can sometimes be too tight if the candle that broke the level isn’t particularly big. If so, move a couple of candles back. Works best with a big (and ideally engulfing) candle     Option 2: furthermost deviation  If bullish: lowest low made before the level was broken again If bearish: highest high made before the level was broken again Conservative, but won’t always give actionable R:R e.g. with rounded retests that made a lot of space    Probability Enhancers  Good level selection: clear, high time frame, violent and significant levels perform better than random highs/lows Second break/break back through the level should be strong and fast: stronger/faster break = less time for those offside to mitigate = more traders trapped. Ideally some sort of engulfing candle First/false break spikes into liquidity: provides a factor of confluence that the first move was a trap Trend considerations  In an uptrend, bullish CDC setups are more likely to form and are higher probability  With the aim of bringing in shorts for long liquidity → upside continuation   In a downtrend, bearish CDC setups are more likely to form and are higher probability  With the aim of bringing in longs for short liquidity → downside continuation       Summary  Next Steps:\n learn more candlestick patterns research into hedging, expectancy, laddering risk management funding liquidations data and stats for the market bullish/bearish divergence indicators for when big players are trading/active in the markets look up more oscillators (MACD, B)  ","permalink":"/posts/cryptocred/cryptocred/","summary":"Link to original videos\n 1: Candlestick Charts What is technical analysis  way to make probabilistic forecasts of future price behaviour  you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a technical trader, you can use it to look for best risk/reward long entries if you\u0026rsquo;re fundamentally bullish on an asset   can be thought of as a risk management tool  Candlestick Anatomy  red = closing price below opening price green = closing price above opening price OHLC = Open, High, Low, Close  Side note: lines drawn on a particular time frame are still displayed at different time frames.","title":"CryptoCred's TA Series"},{"content":"","permalink":"/archive/","summary":"archives","title":"Archive"},{"content":"","permalink":"/search/","summary":"search","title":"Search"}]
