[{"content":"CryptoZombies\u0026rsquo;s Website\n Note: I already have a little bit of programming experience so I will be relating some of the concepts to Javascript/C++ concepts. A great resource for learning Javascript is freeCodeCamp\u0026rsquo;s Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification course\n Lesson 1 Solidity\u0026rsquo;s code is encapsulated in contracts.\ncontract: fundamental building block of Ethereum applications - all variables and functions belong to a contract. Starting point of all your projects\npragma solidity: version of Solidity compiler you wish to use state variables - permanently stored in contract storage\nstructs: - objects\narrarys: - two types:\n fixed arrays: Person[2] fixedArrary; dynmaic arrays: Person[] people; public arrays: Solidity automatically create a getter method: Person[] public people; .push() to add to back of array  functions: - things to note:\n when passing in by reference, use memory start function parameter names with _ good practice to mark private as default (name private function starting with _) returns (string memory): return type view: view-only, no modifications (const in C++) pure: not access any data in the app (Solidity is good at telling you when to use view vs. pure)  keccak256: built in hash function. One purpose is for pseudo-random number generation. Note: not secure.\ntypecasting: converting between data types\nevents: way for your contract to communicate that something happened on the blockchain to your app front-end, which can be \u0026lsquo;listening\u0026rsquo; for certain events and take action when they happen. Web3.js: Javascript library for Ethereum that allows you to write a frontend that interacts with the contract.\npragma solidity \u0026gt;=0.5.0 \u0026lt;0.6.0; contract ZombieFactory { event NewZombie(uint zombieId, string name, uint dna); uint dnaDigits = 16; uint dnaModulus = 10 ** dnaDigits; struct Zombie { string name; uint dna; } Zombie[] public zombies; function _createZombie(string memory _name, uint _dna) private { uint id = zombies.push(Zombie(_name, _dna)) - 1; emit NewZombie(id, _name, _dna); } function _generateRandomDna(string memory _str) private view returns (uint) { uint rand = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_str))); return rand % dnaModulus; } function createRandomZombie(string memory _name) public { uint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name); _createZombie(_name, randDna); } }  Lesson 2 addresses: Owned by a specific user, we can use it as a unique ID for ownership (set to the Ethereum address that called the function)\nmapping: Key-value store for storing and looking up date (dictionaries)\nimport: same as import in Javascript\ninterface: used to interact with another contract on the blockchain (syntactically the same as interfaces in C++). Note: In Solidity, you can return more than one value from a function\nfunctions:\n msg.sender: address of the person (or smart contract) who called the current function. In Solidity, function execution always needs to start with an external caller so there will always be a msg.sender. Gives you security of the Ethereum blockchain (only way to modify somebody elses' data is to steal their private key) require: function stops executing if some condition is not true (like Racket error checking). Note: Solidity does not have native string comparison inheritance: same as inheritance in C++ storage vs. memory: storage is permanent, memory is temporary (eg. hard drive vs RAM or local vs global variable) internal and external:  internal is same as private, but accessible to contracts that inherit this contract external is like public, but functions can ONLY be called from outside the contract    zombiefactory.sol:\npragma solidity \u0026gt;=0.5.0 \u0026lt;0.6.0; contract ZombieFactory { event NewZombie(uint zombieId, string name, uint dna); uint dnaDigits = 16; uint dnaModulus = 10 ** dnaDigits; struct Zombie { string name; uint dna; } Zombie[] public zombies; mapping (uint =\u0026gt; address) public zombieToOwner; mapping (address =\u0026gt; uint) ownerZombieCount; function _createZombie(string memory _name, uint _dna) internal { uint id = zombies.push(Zombie(_name, _dna)) - 1; zombieToOwner[id] = msg.sender; ownerZombieCount[msg.sender]++; emit NewZombie(id, _name, _dna); } function _generateRandomDna(string memory _str) private view returns (uint) { uint rand = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_str))); return rand % dnaModulus; } function createRandomZombie(string memory _name) public { require(ownerZombieCount[msg.sender] == 0); uint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name); randDna = randDna - randDna % 100; _createZombie(_name, randDna); } } zombiefeeding.sol:\npragma solidity \u0026gt;=0.5.0 \u0026lt;0.6.0; import \u0026#34;./zombiefactory.sol\u0026#34;; contract KittyInterface { function getKitty(uint256 _id) external view returns ( bool isGestating, bool isReady, uint256 cooldownIndex, uint256 nextActionAt, uint256 siringWithId, uint256 birthTime, uint256 matronId, uint256 sireId, uint256 generation, uint256 genes ); } contract ZombieFeeding is ZombieFactory { address ckAddress = 0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d; KittyInterface kittyContract = KittyInterface(ckAddress); function feedAndMultiply(uint _zombieId, uint _targetDna, string memory _species) public { require(msg.sender == zombieToOwner[_zombieId]); Zombie storage myZombie = zombies[_zombieId]; _targetDna = _targetDna % dnaModulus; uint newDna = (myZombie.dna + _targetDna) / 2; if(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_species)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked(\u0026#34;kitty\u0026#34;))) { newDna = newDna - newDna % 100 + 99; } _createZombie(\u0026#34;NoName\u0026#34;, newDna); } function feedOnKitty(uint _zombieId, uint _kittyId) public { uint kittyDna; (,,,,,,,,,kittyDna) = kittyContract.getKitty(_kittyId); feedAndMultiply(_zombieId, kittyDna, \u0026#34;kitty\u0026#34;); } }  Lesson 3 After you deploy a contract, it\u0026rsquo;s immutable, meaning it can never be modified or updated again. If there\u0026rsquo;s a flaw in your contract code, there\u0026rsquo;s no way for you to patch it later. You would have to tell your users to start using a different smart contract address that has the fix. Because of this, it is often smart to have a function that allows up to change addresses that rely on external dependencies, in case something happens to those contracts in the future.\nOwnable: contracts that give owners special privileges:\n modifiers: executes before the main function gets executed (mostly used to add require checks). onlyOwner: only the owner can call the function OpenZeppelin: library of secure and community-vetted smart contracts that you can use in your own DApps.  Gas:\n how much gas is required to execute a function depends on how complex the function\u0026rsquo;s logic is, based on how much computing resources will be required to perform that operation (eg. writing to storage is much more expensive than adding two ints) total gas cost is the sum of the gas costs of all its individual operations code optimization is much more important in Ethereum than any other programming language because there is a real cost to users in structs, using smaller-sized uint will allow Solidity to pack these variables together to take up less storage. You also want to cluster identical data types together.  Time Units:\n now: unix timestamp of latest block Solidity also has seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, years as default   ","permalink":"/posts/cryptozombies/","summary":"CryptoZombies\u0026rsquo;s Website\n Note: I already have a little bit of programming experience so I will be relating some of the concepts to Javascript/C++ concepts.

For long investments, like mortgage, there has to be a way to have a long-term stable APY\nExample:\n User deposits 10ETH in Compound, gets a certain number of CETH in return based on exchange rate (eg. new market set to 0.02) CETH then accumulates interest with each ETH block (exchange rate increases depending on supply APY) AAVE is similar except ATokens are pegged to underlying tokens at 1:1  Things to research:\n Alpha Homora  https://defipulse.com/blog/alpha-homora-v2   BadgerDAO  ","permalink":"/posts/defi/","summary":"Sources: Finematics\nNote: I\u0026rsquo;m already familiar with the basics of DeFi (eg. what it is, key projects, Uniswap, MetaMask) so there won\u0026rsquo;t be any notes after those things.

This blog will help document my journey into crypto and trading. Since discovering Bitcoin and crypto 9 months ago, I\u0026rsquo;ve spent all of my free time away from school work researching about everything in the space. I now feel like I have a good understanding of:\n the history and major dates of crypto names and what they do of majority of the Top 100 coins major areas of innovation (eg. DeFi, NFTs) Top DeFi protocols and basic understanding of their value proposition the hottest memes on crypto twitter (I personally think this is the most important)  However, I noticed that there are still various topics that I\u0026rsquo;m still confused about. These include:\n Technical aspects of defi protocols (eg. how SUSHI fees are generated and distributed, how RUNE is able to do cross-chain swaps vs atomic swaps, ALPHA leveraged lending) NFTs (eg. how they are able to verify ownership, what are the next logical \u0026ldquo;next steps\u0026rdquo; for projects in this space) Insurance (eg. how insurance works in the crypto world) Solidity  Since this is a lot of stuff, I thought a blog will allow me to document my learning. I also wish to do a coop in this field so this blog will hopefully act as a sort of \u0026ldquo;resume\u0026rdquo; for the future.\nMost of the posts for the next couple of months will simply be me making notes straight from the videos and resources that I\u0026rsquo;m learning from. However, as time goes on, the goal is to start contributing insightful and critical posts about things that I notice.\nOK;LG!\nAbout me: I\u0026rsquo;m a 20 yr old post-secondary student from Canada. I\u0026rsquo;ve been very interested in learning about investing and trading for a couple of years, but never really got into it. I was originally just looking to start investing in the stock market, but after seeing what happened with the stock market after the March crash and the subsequent \u0026ldquo;V-shaped\u0026rdquo; reversal due to the Fed pumping trillions into the market, I felt like the current financial system didn\u0026rsquo;t have the regular person\u0026rsquo;s best interests at heart. This led me to look for a solution. Luckily, I found it relatively quickly in Bitcoin and \u0026ldquo;The Bitcoin Standard\u0026rdquo; book. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve become sort of obsessed with the rate of innovation in the space and truly believe it will be the future of finance (france, for the ct-inclined).\nAlthough I have not touched the stock market to date, I\u0026rsquo;ve realized that by doing so, I\u0026rsquo;ve created my own \u0026ldquo;crypto bubble\u0026rdquo; where all the arguments and discussions I see online are from people who are pro-Bitcoin and have a financial stake in the success of crypto. This is obviously detrimental to my ability to think critically and objectively about this space. Therefore, I will slowly start researching about traditional equities. The good news is, many of the concepts that I\u0026rsquo;ve picked up on through crypto is applicable to this area as well.\nStructure:  categories will be the broad topics that the blog will be centered around (eg. crypto, trading, stocks, coding) series will be blog posts centered around a particular subsection within a category (eg. Bitcoin, altcoins, React)  There will also be an ongoing \u0026ldquo;book list\u0026rdquo; blog post which will be updated with what books I\u0026rsquo;m reading and any notes about the books I\u0026rsquo;ve finished.\nHow I created the website: The website was created using Hugo and the PaperMod theme and then hosted on GitHub Pages.
